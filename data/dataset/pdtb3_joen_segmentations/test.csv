Consumers may want to move their telephones a little closer to the TV set. 

Couch-potato jocks watching ABC's ""Monday Night Football"" can now vote during halftime for the greatest play in 20 years from among four or five filmed replays.
Two weeks ago, viewers of several NBC daytime consumer segments started calling a 900 number for advice on various life-style issues.
And the new syndicated ""reality"" show ""Hard Copy"" records viewers' opinions for possible airing on the next day's show. 

Interactive telephone technology has taken a new leap in sophistication, and television programmers are racing to exploit the possibilities.
Eventually viewers may grow bored with the technology and resent the cost.
But right now programmers are figuring that viewers who are busy dialing up a range of services may put down their remote control zappers and stay tuned. 

""We've been spending a lot of time in Los Angeles talking to TV production people,"" says Mike Parks, president of Call Interactive, which supplied technology for both ABC Sports and NBC's consumer minutes. ""With the competitiveness of the television market these days, everyone is looking for a way to get viewers more excited."" 

One of the leaders behind the expanded use of 900 numbers is Call Interactive, a joint venture of giants American Express Co. and American Telephone & Telegraph Co. Formed in August, the venture weds AT&T's newly expanded 900 service with 200 voice-activated computers in American Express's Omaha, Neb., service center. 

Other long-distance carriers have also begun marketing enhanced 900 service, and special consultants are springing up to exploit the new tool.
Blair Entertainment, a New York firm that advises TV stations and sells ads for them, has just formed a subsidiary -- 900 Blair -- to apply the technology to television. 

The use of 900 toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in recent years.
For a while, high-cost pornography lines and services that tempt children to dial (and redial) movie or music information earned the service a somewhat sleazy image, but new legal restrictions are aimed at trimming excesses. 

The cost of a 900 call is set by the originator -- ABC Sports, for example -- with the cheapest starting at 75 cents.
Billing is included in a caller's regular phone bill.
From the fee, the local phone company and the long-distance carrier extract their costs to carry the call, passing the rest of the money to the originator, which must cover advertising and other costs. 

In recent months, the technology has become more flexible and able to handle much more volume.
Before, callers of 900 numbers would just listen and not talk, or they'd vote ""yes"" or ""no"" by calling one of two numbers. (People in the phone business call this technology ""900 click."") Now, callers are led through complex menus of choices to retrieve information they want, and the hardware can process 10,000 calls in 90 seconds. 

Up to now, 900 numbers have mainly been used on local TV stations and cable channels.
MTV used one to give away the house that rock star Jon Bon Jovi grew up in.
For several years, Turner Broadcasting System's Cable News Network has invited viewers to respond nightly to topical issues (""Should the U.S. military intervene in Panama?""), but even the hottest controversies on CNN log only about 10,000 calls. 

The newest uses of the 900-interactive technology demonstrate the growing variety of applications.
Capital Cities/ABC Inc., CBS Inc. and General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. unit are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about hunger.
The subject will be written into the plots of prime-time shows, and viewers will be given a 900 number to call.
Callers will be sent educational booklets, and the call's modest cost will be an immediate method of raising money. 

Other network applications have very different goals.
ABC Sports was looking for ways to lift deflated halftime ratings for ""Monday Night Football."" Kurt Sanger, ABC Sports's marketing director, says that now ""tens of thousands"" of fans call its 900 number each week to vote for the best punt return, quarterback sack, etc. 

Profit from the calls goes to charity, but ABC Sports also uses the calls as a sales tool: After thanking callers for voting, Frank Gifford offers a football videotape for $19.95, and 5% of callers stay on the line to order it.
Jackets may be sold next. 

Meanwhile, NBC Sports recently began ""Scores Plus,"" a year-round, 24-hour 900 line providing a complex array of scores, analysis and fan news.
A spokesman said its purpose is ""to bolster the impression that NBC Sports is always there for people."" 

NBC's ""On-Line"" consumer minutes have increased advertiser spending during the day, the network's weakest period.
Each weekday matches a sponsor and a topic: On Mondays, Unilever N.V.'s Lever Bros. sponsors tips on diet and exercise, followed by a 30-second Lever Bros. commercial. 

Viewers can call a 900 number for additional advice, which will be tailored to their needs based on the numbers they punch (""Press one if you're pregnant,"" etc.).
If the caller stays on the line and leaves a name and address for the sponsor, coupons and a newsletter will be mailed, and the sponsor will be able to gather a list of desirable potential customers. 

Diane Seaman, an NBC-TV vice president, says NBC has been able to charge premium rates for this ad time.
She wouldn't say what the premium is, but it's believed to be about 40% above regular daytime rates. ""We were able to get advertisers to use their promotion budget for this, because they get a chance to do couponing,"" says Ms. Seaman. ""And we were able to attract some new advertisers because this is something new."" 

Mr. Parks of Call Interactive says TV executives are considering the use of 900 numbers for ""talk shows, game shows, news and opinion surveys."" Experts are predicting a big influx of new shows in 1990, when a service called ""automatic number information"" will become widely available.
This service identifies each caller's phone number, and it can be used to generate instant mailing lists. 

""Hard Copy,"" the new syndicated tabloid show from Paramount Pictures, will use its 900 number for additional purposes that include research, says executive producer Mark B. von S. Monsky. ""For a piece on local heroes of World War II, we can ask people to leave the name and number of anyone they know who won a medal,"" he says. ""That'll save us time and get people involved."" 

But Mr. Monsky sees much bigger changes ahead. ""These are just baby steps toward real interactive video, which I believe will be the biggest thing yet to affect television,"" he says.
Although it would be costly to shoot multiple versions, TV programmers could let audiences vote on different endings for a movie.
Fox Broadcasting experimented with this concept last year when viewers of ""Married . . . With Children"" voted on whether Al should say ""I love you"" to Peg on Valentine's Day. 

Someday, viewers may also choose different depths of news coverage. ""A menu by phone could let you decide, `I'm interested in just the beginning of story No. 1, and I want story No. 2 in depth,"" Mr. Monsky says. ""You'll start to see shows where viewers program the program.""

Integrated Resources Inc., the troubled financial-services company that has been trying to sell its core companies to restructure debt, said talks with a potential buyer ended. 

Integrated didn't identify the party or say why the talks failed.
Last week another potential buyer, Whitehall Financial Group -- which had agreed in August to purchase most of Integrated's core companies for $310 million -- ended talks with Integrated. 

Integrated said that it would continue to pursue ""other alternatives"" to sell the five core companies and that a group of senior executives plans to make a proposal to purchase three of the companies -- Integrated Resources Equity Corp., Resources Trust Co. and Integrated Resources Asset Management Corp.
A price wasn't disclosed. 

Integrated also said it expects to report a second-quarter loss wider than the earlier estimate of about $600 million.
The company didn't disclose the new estimate but said the change was related to Integrated's failure to sell its core businesses, as well as ""other events,"" which it didn't detail, that occurred after its announcement last week that it was in talks with the unidentified prospective buyer. 

Meanwhile, a number of top sales producers from Integrated Resources Equity will meet this afternoon in Chicago to discuss their options.
The unit is a loosely constructed group of about 3,900 independent brokers and financial planners who sell insurance, annuities, limited partnerships, mutual funds and other investments for Integrated and other firms. 

The sales force is viewed as a critical asset in Integrated's attempt to sell its core companies.
Whitehall cited concerns about how long Integrated would be able to hold together the sales force as one reason its talks with Integrated failed. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Integrated closed at $1.25 a share, down 25 cents.
Integrated has been struggling to avoid a bankruptcy-law filing since June, when it failed to make interest payments on nearly $1 billion of debt.
Integrated senior and junior creditors are owed a total of about $1.8 billion.

Alpine Group Inc. revised its exchange offer for $43.7 million face amount of 13.5% senior subordinated debt due 1996 and extended the offer to Oct. 27 from Oct. 12. 

The Hackensack, N.J., company said holders would receive for each $1,000 face amount, $750 face amount of a new issue of secured senior subordinated notes, convertible into common stock at an initial rate of $6.50 a share, and 50 common shares.
The new notes will bear interest at 5.5% through July 31, 1991, and thereafter at 10%. 

Under the original proposal, the maker of specialty coatings and a developer of information-display technologies offered $400 of notes due 1996, 10 common shares and $175 in cash for each $1,000 face amount. 

Completion of the exchange offer is subject to the tender of at least 80% of the debt, among other things.
Alpine, which said it doesn't plan to further extend the offer, said it received $615,000 face amount of debt under the original offer.

The stock of UAL Corp. continued to be pounded amid signs that British Airways may balk at any hasty reformulation of the aborted $6.79 billion buy-out of United Airlines' parent. 

UAL stock plummeted a further $24.875 to $198 on volume of more than 2.8 million shares in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The plunge followed a drop of $56.875 Monday, amid indications the takeover may take weeks to be revived. 

The stock has fallen $87.25, or 31%, in the three trading days since announcement of the collapse of the $300-a-share takeover jolted the entire stock market into its second-worst plunge ever. ""This is a total bloodbath"" for takeover-stock traders, one investment banker said. 

Los Angeles financier Marvin Davis, who put United in play with a $5.4 billion bid two months ago, last night proffered both a ray of hope and an extra element of uncertainty by saying he remains interested in acquiring UAL.
But he dropped his earlier $300-a-share back-up bid, saying he must first explore bank financing. 

Even as Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. scrambled to line up bank financing for a revised version of the lapsed labor-management bid, British Airways, a 15% partner in the buying group, indicated it wants to start from scratch.
Its partners are United's pilots, who were to own 75%, and UAL management at 10%. 

Adding insult to injury, United's 25,000-member Machinists' union, which helped scuttle financing for the first bid, yesterday asked UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL directors to resign.
A similar demand was made by a group that represents some of United's 26,000 noncontract employees.
John Peterpaul, Machinists union general vice president, attacked Mr. Wolf as ""greedy and irresponsible"" for pursuing the buy-out.
Although Mr. Wolf and John Pope, UAL's chief financial officer, stood to pocket $114.3 million for stock and options in the buy-out, UAL executives planned to reinvest only $15 million in the new company. 

The blue-collar machinists, longtime rivals of the white-collar pilots, say the buyout would load the company with debt and weaken its finances. 

Confusion about the two banks' hurried efforts to round up financing for a new bid that the UAL board hasn't even seen yet helped send UAL stock spiraling downward.
And rumors of forced selling by takeover-stock traders triggered a 25-point downdraft in the Dow Jones Industrial Average around 11:15 a.m. EDT yesterday. 

Yesterday's selling began after a Japanese news agency reported that Japanese banks, which balked at the first bid, were ready to reject a revised version at around $250 a share, or $5.65 billion.
Several reports as the day progressed gave vague or conflicting indications about whether banks would sign up. 

Citicorp, for example, said only that it had ""expressions of interest of a transaction from both the borrowers and the banks,"" but didn't have an agreement. 

Late in the day, Mr. Wolf issued a onepage statement calling Mr. Peterpaul's blast ""divisive and uncalled for."" But he gave few details on the progress toward a new bid, saying only, ""We are working toward a revised proposal for majority employee ownership."" 

Meanwhile, in another sign that a new bid isn't imminent, it was learned that the UAL board held a telephone meeting Monday to hear an update on the situation, but that a formal board meeting isn't likely to be convened until early next week. 

In London, British Airways Chairman Lord King was quoted in the Times as declaring he is ""not prepared to take my shareholders into a hasty deal."" Observers said it appeared that British Air was angered at the way the bid has degenerated into confusion, as well as by the banks' effort to round up financing for what one called ""a deal that isn't a deal."" 

The effort to revive the bid was complicated by the unwieldy nature of the three-party buying group.
The pilots were meeting outside Chicago yesterday.
But British Air, which was to have supplied $750 million out of $965 million in equity financing, apparently wasn't involved in the second proposal and could well reject it even if banks obtain financing. 

A group of United's noncontract employees said in a statement, ""The fact that Wolf and other officers were going to line their pockets with literally millions of dollars while instituting severe pay cuts on the nonunion employees of United is not only deplorable but inexcusable."" The machinists also asked for an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible securities-law violations in the original bid for UAL by Mr. Davis, as well as in the response by UAL. Last week, just before the bank commitments were due, the union asked the U.S. Labor Department to study whether the bid violated legal standards of fairness governing employee investment funds. 

In his statement, Mr. Wolf said, ""We continue to believe our approach is sound, and that it is far better for all employees than the alternative of having an outsider own the company with employees paying for it just the same."" 

Mr. Wolf has eschewed merger advice from a major Wall Street securities firm, relying instead only on a takeover lawyer, Peter Atkins of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom. 

The huge drop in UAL stock prompted one takeover stock trader, George Kellner, managing partner of Kellner, DiLeo & Co., to deny publicly rumors that his firm was going out of business.
Mr. Kellner said that despite losses on UAL stock, his firm's health is ""excellent."" 

The stock's decline also has left the UAL board in a quandary.
Although it may not be legally obligated to sell the company if the buy-out group can't revive its bid, it may have to explore alternatives if the buyers come back with a bid much lower than the group's original $300-a-share proposal. 

At a meeting Sept. 1 to consider the labor-management bid, the board also was informed by its investment adviser, First Boston Corp., of interest expressed by buy-out funds including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Forstmann Little & Co., as well as by Robert Bass, Morgan Stanley's buy-out fund, and Pan Am Corp. 

The takeover-stock traders were hoping that Mr. Davis or one of the other interested parties might re-emerge with the situation in disarray, or that the board might consider a recapitalization. 

Meanwhile, Japanese bankers said they were still hesitant about accepting Citicorp's latest proposal.

Macmillan Inc. said it plans a public offering of 8.4 million shares of its Berlitz International Inc. unit at $19 to $21 a share. 

The offering for the language school unit was announced by Robert Maxwell, chairman and chief executive officer of London-based Maxwell Communication Corp., which owns Macmillan. 

After the offering is completed, Macmillan will own about 56% of the Berlitz common stock outstanding.
Five million shares will be offered in the U.S., and 3.4 million additional shares will be offered in concurrent international offerings outside the U.S. Goldman, Sachs & Co. will manage the offering. 

Macmillan said Berlitz intends to pay quarterly dividends on the stock.
The company said it expects to pay the first dividend, of 12.5 cents a share, in the 1990 first quarter. 

Berlitz will borrow an amount equal to its expected net proceeds from the offerings, plus $50 million, in connection with a credit agreement with lenders.
The total borrowing will be about $208 million, the company said.
Proceeds from the borrowings under the credit agreement will be used to pay an $80 million cash dividend to Macmillan and to lend the remainder of about $128 million to Maxwell Communications in connection with a promissory note. 

Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay borrowings under the short-term parts of a credit agreement. 

Berlitz, which is based in Princeton, N.J., provides language instruction and translation services through more than 260 language centers in 25 countries.
In the past five years, more than 68% of its sales have been outside the U.S. Macmillan has owned Berlitz since 1966. 

In the first six months of this year, Berlitz posted net income of $7.6 million on sales of $106.2 million, compared with net income of $8.2 million on sales of $90.6 million.

Right away you notice the following things about a Philip Glass concert.
It attracts people with funny hair (or with no hair -- in front of me a girl with spiked locks sat beside a boy who had shaved his).
Whoever constitute the local Left Bank come out in force, dressed in black, along with a smattering of yuppies who want to be on the cutting edge.
People in Glass houses tend to look stoned.
And, if still conscious at the evening's end, you notice something else: The audience, at first entranced and hypnotized by the music, releases its pent-up feelings in collective gratitude. 

Currently in the middle of a four-week, 20-city tour as a solo pianist, Mr. Glass has left behind his synthesizers, equipment and collaborators in favor of going it alone.
He sits down at the piano and plays.
And plays.
Either one likes it or one doesn't.
The typical Glass audience, which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers, certainly does. 

The work, though, sounds like Muzak for spaceships.
Philip Glass is the emperor, and his music the new clothes, of the avant-garde.
His success is easy to understand.
Softly introducing and explaining his pieces, Mr. Glass looks and sounds more like a shaggy poet describing his work than a classical pianist playing a recital.
The piano compositions, which have been labeled variously as minimalist, Oriental, repetitive, cyclical, monophonic and hypnotic, are relentlessly tonal (therefore unthreatening), unvaryingly rhythmic (therefore soporific), and unflaggingly harmonious but unmelodic (therefore both pretty and unconventional).
It is music for people who want to hear something different but don't want to work especially hard at the task.
It is E-Z listening for the now generation. 

Mr. Glass has inverted the famous modernist dictum ""less is more."" His more is always less.
Far from being minimalist, the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised in the simplicities of 4/4 time, octave intervals, and ragtime or gospel chord progressions.
But the music has its charm, and Mr. Glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex. ""Opening"" (1981), from Glassworks, introduces the audience to the Glass technique: Never straying too far from the piano's center, Mr. Glass works in the two octaves on either side of middle C, and his fingers seldom leave the keys.
There is a recognizable musical style here, but not a particular performance style.
The music is not especially pianistic; indeed, it's hard to imagine a bad performance of it.
Nothing bravura, no arpeggios, no ticklish fingering problems challenge the performer.
We hear, we may think, inner voices, but they all seem to be saying the same thing. 

With ""Planet News,"" music meant to accompany readings of Allen Ginsberg's ""Wichita Vortex Sutra,"" Mr. Glass gets going.
His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard.
Seventh chords make you feel as though he may break into a (very slow) improvisatory riff.
The chords modulate, but there is little filigree even though his fingers begin to wander over more of the keys.
Contrasts predictably accumulate: First the music is loud, then it becomes soft, then (you realize) it becomes louder again. ""The Fourth Knee Play,"" an interlude from ""Einstein on the Beach,"" is like a toccata but it doesn't seem to move much beyond its left-hand ground in ""Three Blind Mice."" 

When Mr. Glass decides to get really fancy, he crosses his hands and hits a resonant bass note with his right hand.
He does this in at least three of his solo pieces.
You might call it a leitmotif or a virtuoso accomplishment.
In ""Mad Rush,"" which came from a commission to write a piece of indeterminate length (Mr.
Glass charmingly, and tellingly, confessed that ""this was no problem for me""), an A section alternates with a B section several times before the piece ends unresolved. 

Not only is the typical Glasswork open-ended, it is also often multiple in its context(s). ""Mad Rush"" began its life as the accompaniment to the Dalai Lama's first public address in the U.S., when Mr. Glass played it on the organ at New York's Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
Later it was performed on Radio Bremen in Germany, and then Lucinda Childs took it for one of her dance pieces.
The point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything. 

The evening ended with Mr. Glass's ""Metamorphosis,"" another multiple work.
Parts 1, 2, and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris's acclaimed film, ""The Thin Blue Line,"" and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the Kafka story of the same name.
When used as background in this way, the music has an appropriate eeriness, as when a two-note phrase, a descending minor third, accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports, interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film.
Served up as a solo, however, the music lacks the resonance provided by a context within another medium. 

Admirers of Mr. Glass may agree with the critic Richard Kostelanetz's sense that the 1974 ""Music in Twelve Parts"" is as encyclopedic and weighty as ""The Well-Tempered Clavier."" But while making the obvious point that both composers develop variations from themes, this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of Mr. Glass's music.
Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical Stravinsky, the genuinely radical minimalism of Berg and Webern, and what in retrospect even seems like concision in Mahler. 

Mr. Spiegelman is professor of English at Southern Methodist University and editor of the Southwest Review.

Honeywell Inc. said it hopes to complete shortly the first of two sales of shares in its Japanese joint venture, Yamatake-Honeywell, for about $280 million. 

The company wouldn't disclose the buyer of the initial 16% stake. 

Proceeds of the sale, expected to be completed next week, would be used to repurchase as many as 10 million shares of Honeywell stock, the company said. 

Honeywell said it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in Yamatake-Honeywell, but indicated it intends to hold at least 20% of the joint venture's stock long term.
A 20% stake would allow Honeywell to include Yamatake earnings in its results. 

Honeywell previously said it intended to reduce its holding in the Japanese concern as part of a restructuring plan which also calls for a reduction of dependence on weapons sales.
Yesterday a spokeswoman said the company was ""pleased with our progress"" in that regard and ""hopes to provide additional details soon."" 

Honeywell said its Defense and Marine Systems group incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during the third quarter, resulting in lower operating profit for that business. 

Overall, Honeywell reported earnings of $74.4 million, or $1.73 a share, for the three months ended Oct. 1 compared with a loss of $41.4 million, or 98 cents a share, a year earlier.
The previous period's results included a $108 million pretax charge related to unrecoverable contract costs and a $12.3 million pretax gain on real estate sales.
Sales for the latest quarter were flat, at $1.72 billion. 

For the nine months, Honeywell reported earnings of $212.1 million, or $4.92 a share, compared with earnings of $47.9 million, or $1.13 a share, a year earlier.
Sales declined slightly to $5.17 billion.

Once again, your editorial page misstates the law to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions.
In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups, Michael S. Greve informs your readers, "". . . the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense, rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge"" (""Congress's Environmental Buccaneers,"" Sept. 18). 

This statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive, but it is simply wrong.
The Clean Water Act contains no ""legal standard"" of zero discharge.
It requires that ""discharges of pollutants"" into the ""waters of the United States"" be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301.
Whatever may be the problems with this system, it scarcely reflects ""zero risk"" or ""zero discharge."" 

Perhaps Mr. Greve was confused by Congress's meaningless statement of ""the national goal"" in section 101, which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges -- by 1985, no less.
This fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in 1972, and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute. 

Thus, you do the public a great disservice when Mr. Greve suggests, even facetiously, that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water; your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them, as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters, from the hairyknuckled knock of the Sierra Club at their doors.

National Geographic, the sixth-largest U.S. magazine, is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy, high-toned pages that upscale advertisers love. 

So why did advertising pages plunge by almost 10% and ad revenue by 7.2% in the first half? 

To hear advertisers tell it, the magazine just hasn't kept up with the times.
Despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the Third World, it hasn't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women.
Worse, it lagged behind competitors in offering now-standard gimmicks, from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers. 

But now, the magazine is attempting to fight back, with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign.
Advertisers don't think of the magazine first, says Joan McCraw, who joined in April as national advertising director. ""What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance.
People didn't believe we were in tune with the marketplace, and in many ways we weren't."" 

The 101-year-old magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before.
It largely rested on its hard-to-fault demographics: 10.8 million subscribers in the first half, up from 10.5 million a year ago; an average age of 42 for readers -- at the height of their consuming years; loyalty to the tune of an 85% average subscription renewal rate. 

The magazine had its best year yet in 1988, when it celebrated its centennial and racked up a 17% gain in ad pages, to 283.
But this year, when the hullabaloo surrounding its centennial died, so too did some advertiser interest.
The reason, ad executives say, is that the entire magazine business has been soft -- and National Geographic has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market. 

Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices -- $130,000 for a four-color page, vs. $47,000 for the Smithsonian, a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation.
When ad dollars are tight, the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers, who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all. 

Even though National Geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like Smithsonian, ""the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency,""says Harry Glass, New York media manager for Bozell Inc. 

To combat that problem, National Geographic, like other magazines, began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines -- for example, ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest 25 markets. 

But the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions, and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors.
Time magazine, for example, has more than 100 separate editions going to different regions, top management, and other groups. 

Another sticking point for advertisers was National Geographic's tradition of lumping its ads together, usually at the beginning or end of the magazine, rather than spreading ads out among its articles, as most magazines do.
And National Geographic's smaller-than-average size means extra production costs for advertisers. 

But Ms. McCraw says the magazine is fighting back.
It now offers 30 regional editions, it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles, and it has been beefing up its sales force.
And it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives, marketing directors, and media executives just that. 

The centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign, into which the magazine will pour about $500,000, mostly in the next few weeks.
The campaign, created by Omnicom Group's DDB Needham agency, takes advantage of the eye-catching photography that National Geographic is known for.
In one ad, a photo of the interior of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris is paired with the headline, ""The only book more respected than ours doesn't accept advertising."" Another ad pictures a tree ant, magnified 80 times, with the headline, ""For impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions."" 

Ms. McCraw says she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in 10 categories, including corporate, financial services, consumer electronics, insurance and food.
Her goal: to top 300 ad pages in 1990, up from about 274 this year.
Whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain. ""The ad campaign is meant to contemporize the thought of National Geographic,"" she says. ""We want it to be a '90s kind of image."" 

WCRS Plans Ad-Unit Sale 

WCRS Group hopes to announce, perhaps today, an agreement to sell the majority of its ad unit to Paris-based Eurocom, a European ad executive said. 

WCRS has been in discussions with Eurocom for several months.
However, when negotiations bogged down recently, WCRS's chief executive, Peter Scott, met in Paris with another French firm, Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit, or BDDP. 

According to the executive, BDDP's involvement prompted renewed vigor in the WCRS-Eurocom talks and the two agencies were hoping to hammer out details by today.
Executives of the two agencies couldn't be reached last night.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges, a move almost certain to infuriate exchange officials and traders. 

The CFTC said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites ""problems"" associated with the practice.
Dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers. 

The issue exploded this year after a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges, dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations.
Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders' customer orders. 

Traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders. 

The exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they don't have a customer order in hand.
The exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration. 

The CFTC may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions.
The agency didn't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed, but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them.
Wendy Gramm, the agency's chairman, told the Senate Agriculture Committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by Thanksgiving. 

The study, by the CFTC's division of economic analysis, shows that ""a trade is a trade,"" a member of the study team said.
Whether a trade is done on a dual or non-dual basis, the member said, ""doesn't seem to have much economic impact."" 

Currently, most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts, which makes them brokers, or for their own accounts as socalled locals. ""The tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market,"" Mrs. Gramm told the Senate panel. 

Members of Congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize CFTC operations.
The House's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more, comprising those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system.
The Senate bill would force the CFTC to suspend dual trading if an exchange can't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses. 

So far, one test of restricting dual trading has worked well.
The Chicago Merc banned dual trading in its Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures pit in 1987.
Under the rules, traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers.
Traders who stand on the pit's top step, where most customer orders are executed, can't trade for themselves. 

A Merc spokesman said the plan hasn't made much difference in liquidity in the pit. ""It's too soon to tell . . . but people don't seem to be unhappy with it,"" he said.
He said he wouldn't comment on the CFTC plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal. 

But at a meeting last week, Tom Donovan, the Board of Trade's president, told commodity lawyers: ""Dual trading is definitely worth saving.
It adds something to the market.""

Japanese Firms Push 

Posh Car Showrooms 

JAPANESE luxury-car makers are trying to set strict design standards for their dealerships.
But some dealers are negotiating looser terms, while others decline to deal at all. 

Nissan Motor Co. 's Infiniti division likes to insist that every dealer construct and furnish a building in a Japanese style.
Specifications include a polished bronze sculpture at the center of each showroom and a tile bridge spanning a stream that flows into the building from outside. 

""Infiniti has it down to the ashtrays,"" says Jay Ferron, a partner at J.D. Power & Associates, an auto research firm. 

Toyota Motor Corp. 's Lexus division also provides specifications.
But only two-thirds of Lexus dealers are constructing new buildings according to the Lexus specs.
Some are even coming up with their own novel designs.
In Louisville, Ky., for example, David Peterson has built a Lexus dealership with the showroom on the second floor. 

Yet some dealers have turned down Infiniti or Lexus franchises because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements.
Lee Seidman of Cleveland says Infiniti ""was a bear on interiors"" but at least let him retrofit an existing building -- without the stream.
Mr. Seidman says he turned down a Lexus franchise in part because ""the building was gorgeous but very expensive."" 

To head off arguments, Infiniti offers dealers cash bonuses and low-interest construction loans. 

Dictation Device's Saga 

Plays Back a Lesson 

PRODUCTS DON'T have to be first to be winners.
That's the lesson offered through one case study featured in a design exhibit. 

Dictaphone Corp. was caught off guard in 1974 when its main competitor, Lanier Office Products of Japan, introduced a microcassette dictation recorder half the size of standard cassette devices.
Blocked by patent protection from following suit, Dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in half again -- down to the length of a paperclip.
By 1979, designers and engineers at Dictaphone, a Pitney Bowes subsidiary, had produced a working model of a ""picocassette"" recorder. 

By 1982, however, the patent status of the Lanier microcassette had changed, permitting Dictaphone to develop its own competitive micro system, which it did.
Marketing and sales departments then urged abandonment of the pico project.
But others said pico should proceed.
Both were right. 

Dictaphone went ahead and introduced the pico in 1985, but it hasn't sold well.
To date, says Emil Jachmann, a Dictaphone vice president, it has ""broken even or shown a small loss."" 

Nevertheless, the device has been successful in other ways.
It helped Dictaphone attract better engineers, and it provided new technology for other company products.
The picocassette recorder also helped transform the company's reputation from follower to leading-edge innovator. 

""It gave me great pride to see the inventor of the microcassette in Japan look at the pico and shake his head and say `unbelievable, '"" says Mr. Jachmann. 

Dictaphone's picocassette recorder is one of 13 case studies in the TRIAD Design Project, sponsored by the Design Management Institute of Boston and Harvard Business School.
The studies are on exhibit at Harvard this month and will travel to Chicago's Institute of Design and the University of California at Berkeley. 

A Rake's Progress 

Means Branching Out 

ONE DAY Carl Barrett of Mobile, Ala., was raking some sycamore leaves, but the rake kept riding up over the piles.
The harder he tried to push them into large piles, the closer he came to breaking the rake and straining his back. 

So Mr. Barrett, then vice president of the Alabama Steamship Association, took a steel-toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake about nine inches up.
His crude device worked: The lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile, while the higher, harder teeth moved the top of the pile.
Now incorporated into a polypropylene rake, the four-inch prongs, or ""wonderbars,"" also are supposed to aid in picking up leaves. 

One customer, Donald Blaggs of Mobile, says the Barrett Rake allowed him to do his lawn in 2 1/2 hours, two hours less than usual. 

But other rake makers have their doubts.
Richard Mason, president of Ames Co. in Parkersburg, W. Va., says the Barrett rake ""makes sense,"" but it would be ""tough"" to explain to consumers. 

John Stoner, marketing director for True Temper Corp., a subsidiary of Black & Decker, says people don't want to move a leaf pile. ""They either pick it up,"" he says, ""or they start pulling from a fresh direction."" 

Odds and Ends NO MORE STUBBED toes or bruised shins, promises Geste Corp. of Goshen, Ind., the designer of a bed support to replace traditional frames.
Four tubular steel ""Bedfellows,"" each roughly in the shape of a ""W,"" are attached to the bottom of the box spring in a recessed position. . . . Nearly half of U.S. consumers say they'll pay up to 5% more for packaging that can be recycled or is biodegradable, according to a survey commissioned by the Michael Peters Group, a design consultant.

The Pentagon is a haunted house.
Living there for six years was really scary.
The ghosts of the past are everywhere: They are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget. 

Some can be bought off relatively cheaply.
During the Korean War, Gen. Douglas MacArthur demanded and got, in addition to his U.N. command in Korea, his own naval command in Japan, NavforJapan.
Those obsolete operations cost less than $2 billion a year, and keep Mac's ghost quiet. 

That's about all it costs to appease Adm. Erich Raeder's ghost.
In 1941, Raeder and the German navy threatened to attack the Panama Canal, so we created the Southern Command in Panama.
The Southern Command has grown even bigger since the war because Raeder's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega.
The Command's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act's six points, Cap Weinberger's seven points, the Intelligence Committee's 32 points and Woodrow Wilson's 14 points necessary to justify U.S. support.
So far no one has. 

The ghost of the Soviet brigade discovered in Cuba back in the '70s costs just a few hundred million: the price of the Caribbean Command in Key West that President Carter created in 1980.
The brigade hasn't been heard from since, but we keep the staff around just in case. 

George Marshall's ghost is much more difficult to keep happy.
We keep a lot of shrines to him around the Pentagon: statues, busts, relics and such.
The Army headquarters on the third deck of the Pentagon used to burn a lot of incense to him, but the Navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it.
You see, Marshall had this thing about the Navy and the Marines -- he wanted to make them part of the Army but Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal blocked him.
Now his ghost won't let up till it's done. 

To keep him quiet we invent a new unified command every year or so run by the Army or the Air Force and put more of the Navy and Marines under it.
But we still hear him moaning at night because the Navy has a few ships left, and to satisfy him the Navy's sea lift forces were given to a new Air Force bureaucracy in Illinois, its space operations to another command in Colorado, the frogmen to a new Army bureaucracy in Fort Bragg, and the Navy's Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf forces to an Army bureaucracy in Florida. 

Which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all -- the ghost of the shah of Iran.
When the shah died, President Carter was so scared that the shah's ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the ayatollah that he declared the Carter Doctrine.
Mr. Carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab Iran.
But that ghost wouldn't settle for words, he wanted money and people -- lots.
So Mr. Carter formed three new Army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in Tampa called the Rapid Deployment Force.
But that ghost wasn't fooled; he knew the RDF was neither rapid nor deployable nor a force -- even though it cost $8 billion or $10 billion a year. 

After Mr. Carter was defeated in 1980, the shah's ghost claimed the credit and then went after President Reagan and Cap Weinberger.
I saw what he did to them firsthand.
It made my shoelaces dance with terror.
Why, he used to lay in wait for Cap; suddenly he'd leap from behind some statue of Marshall onto Cap's chest and grab him by the throat and choke him till he coughed up an additional $2 billion or so. 

Cap added four more divisions to the Army, two active and two reserve; two carrier groups to the Navy; a division -- equivalent to the Marines; and the C-5B, KC-10, C-17 and a thousand tactical aircraft to the Air Force.
He bought $4 billion in prepositioning ships and $7 billion in ammo and equipment to fill them, and parked them at a new $6 billion base at Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean.
He dedicated all these new forces to the Persian Gulf. 

One night both Marshall's ghost and the shah's ghost together caught Cap and threw him to the ground.
Before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the RDF in Tampa and renamed it Central Command.
He gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. 

Marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers -- someday maybe they would get the whole Navy.
They had fun moving the carriers around, but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers.
But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap, so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $7 billion of loading barges, ramps, etc., in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains. 

Then suddenly Ike's ghost came to visit and said, ""What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away?
We'd get our asses kicked."" Lucky for Cap, Ike was easygoing and soon went away, while the shah -- he kept coming back.
So the U.S. found itself paying about $2 billion in baksheesh to various Arab potentates for basing rights around the Indian Ocean. 

We had great success in Somalia.
But then it turned out that President Siad Barrah was not at all a nice person and the Navy pointed out that the base he promised us in Berbera had silted up about a hundred years ago and anyway was 1,244 miles from the mouth of the Gulf. (But who's counting.) Still, Berbera was the best we could get, so we stay in bed with President Barrah.
All these reports about him committing genocide are probably exaggerated anyway. 

But wouldn't you know, now that we are spending jillions of dollars, and have built those new divisions and new air wings, and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the Russians in Iran, the Russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject.
Meanwhile, Congress is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget. 

Predictably, some Navy guys said: ""Do we still need to keep all 18 Army divisions on active duty and all those extra land-based aircraft without bases and all those Army guys playing admiral in Tampa?
Couldn't we save $20 billion or $30 billion a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves?
And why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by abolishing Central Command and putting responsibility for Gulf naval operations back where it belongs, afloat with the task force commander in the Gulf?
And where were all our handsomely paid Indian Ocean allies last year when our convoys were being attacked?"" 

Questions like that really stir up Marshall's ghost.
He appeared late one night in the bedroom of the new defense secretary, Dick Cheney.
Marshall came clanking in like Marley's ghost dragging those chains of brigades and air wings and links with Arab despots.
He wouldn't leave until Mr. Cheney promised to do whatever the Pentagon systems analysts told him. 

So next day Mr. Cheney went out and did just that: He canceled the 600-ship Navy and cut back one carrier and 20 frigates.
Then he canceled production of the Navy's most important carrier aircraft, the F-14 and the A-6.
On the other hand, Mr. Cheney retained all those new land forces.
Marshall's ghost is satisfied for now, but he'll be back. 

What with Halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming, more and more Pentagon bureaucrats are crawling under their desks.
They know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships.
Then the whole thing will start to collapse, just as it did in the 1970s, and the ghosts and banshees will be howling through the place turning people's hair white.
Gives me the willies just thinking about it. 

Mr. Lehman, a Reagan Navy secretary, is a managing director of PaineWebber.

The metal and marble lobby of CenTrust Bank's headquarters is grander than your average savings and loan.
For one thing, there is an old master on the wall -- ""Samuel Anointing David,"" a big baroque canvas painted by Mattia Preti, a 17th-century Neapolitan. 

At the moment, however, the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed CenTrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive, David L. Paul.
In an international buying spree that began barely two years ago, Mr. Paul amassed a collection of about 30 pre-18th-century works, including the Preti, at a total cost of $28 million. 

By midnight Oct. 6, all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off, under orders from Florida's comptroller, whose office regulates the state's S&Ls.
CenTrust didn't meet the deadline. 

The collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan Mr. Paul had in which the art was to do double duty -- as an investment for CenTrust and as decoration for the S&L's new office tower, designed by I.M. Pei.
The rub is that the $28 million was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as CenTrust was losing money hand over fist.
Mr. Paul had no right to buy art for the S&L in the first place -- it isn't on the comptroller's ""permissible"" list -- without seeking a special dispensation, which he did not do.
Besides that, some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of CenTrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman's estate on La Gorce Isle off Miami Beach. 

Last spring, the comptroller's office called a halt to Mr. Paul's fling, giving him six months to sell the paintings.
The acquisitions, officials said in a letter to Mr. Paul, were ""unsafe, unsound and unauthorized."" So far, Mr. Paul has unloaded but three of his masterpieces, he won't say to whom.
The comptroller's office says it is ""monitoring the situation."" Though the agency could remove Mr. Paul, it has no current intention to do that. 

""It's not like selling Chevrolets,"" Mr. Paul says, as he takes a drag on a goldbanded St. Moritz cigarette. ""The last six months has established the quality of the collection.
There's no fire sale here."" 

Despite Mr. Paul's characteristic hauteur, the 50-year-old, chain-smoking dynamo is finding that getting CenTrust -- Florida's largest thrift institution -- out of its riskiest investments is much tougher than getting into them had been.
Paintings are just part of the picture.
Although Mr. Paul has pared a $1.35 billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $900 million since April, the high-yield debt market has plummeted.
Divesting itself of what is left, as is required of all thrift institutions by July 1994 under the new federal S&L bailout law, may well prove difficult. 

And CenTrust has other problems.
Late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock -- a move that suggests deep concern about an institution.
Mr. Paul has a plan to bring in $150 million by selling off 63 of CenTrust's 71 branches, but it has yet to be approved by regulators. 

It is Mr. Paul's art venture, however, that has drawn the most attention from investors and regulators, not to mention galleries throughout the world.
Embittered shareholders (some of whom are suing) say the chairman and his collection epitomize the excesses of speculation that set off the national S&L crisis. (CenTrust shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of $15.125 in 1986 to close yesterday at $2.875.) Gallery directors, meanwhile, say Mr. Paul and others of his ilk have left an indelible mark on the art world -- and not for the better. 

Collectors don't say ""It's a van Gogh"" anymore, laments Harry Brooks, the president of Wildenstein & Co., a New York gallery. ""They say, `Johnny Payson got $53 million for his, so certainly $10 million isn't too much for mine. ' The great collectors we depended on, such as Paul Mellon or Norton Simon, have stopped buying, and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting. . . ."" Mr. Payson, an art dealer and collector, sold Vincent van Gogh's ""Irises"" at a Sotheby's auction in November 1987 to Australian businessman Alan Bond. (Trouble is, Mr. Bond has yet to pay up, and until he does, Sotheby's has the painting under lock and key.) 

When Mr. Paul moved in on the art market, he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by CenTrust. 

He established his reputation as a freespender in January last year at Sotheby's auction of the Linda and Gerald Guterman collection in New York.
There, on one of his first shopping trips, Mr. Paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices.
He paid $2.2 million, for instance, for a still life by Jan Jansz. den Uyl that was expected to fetch perhaps $700,000.
The price paid was a record for the artist. (Some 64% of items offered at the Guterman auction were sold, at an average price of $343,333.
The rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids.) Afterward, Mr. Paul is said by Mr. Guterman to have phoned Mr. Guterman, the New York developer selling the collection, and gloated. 

""He says he `stole them, '"" recalls Mr. Guterman. ""And he tells me, `If you want to see your paintings, you'll have to come to my house in Florida. '"" Mr. Paul denies phoning and gloating. ""It's just not true,"" he says. 

Mr. Paul quickly became more aggressive in his collecting, with the help of George Wachter, a Sotheby's expert in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the Guterman items.
Mr. Wachter, who became his principal adviser, searched galleries in London, Paris and Monaco.
And, according to one dealer, Mr. Wachter had a penchant for introducing Mr. Paul with the phrase: ""He can buy anything."" 

Nicholas Hall, the president of the Colnaghi U.S.A. Ltd. gallery in New York, sold Mr. Paul ""Abraham and Sarah in the Wilderness"" by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.
Mr. Hall says Mr. Paul ""was known to spend a lot of money.
People were interested in seeing him, but it was recognized that the route was through Sotheby's and particularly George Wachter."" 

Mr. Paul thus developed a close, symbiotic relationship with Sotheby's.
Mr. Paul was eager to assemble a collection for the headquarters CenTrust has been moving into for the greater part of a year.
Sotheby's, the auction house founded in London 1744 and now under the umbrella of Sotheby's Holdings Inc., was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it strove to build its U.S. business.
European dealers continued to dominate the action in old masters, which Sotheby's North America had lately been touting in this country. 

For several months, there was optimism all around.
Last October, Mr. Paul paid out $12 million of CenTrust's cash -- plus a $1.2 million commission -- for ""Portrait of a Man as Mars."" The painting, attributed to Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens, was purchased privately through Sotheby's, not at auction. 

In March 1989, just 15 months into his campaign, Mr. Paul was named by Art & Antiques magazine as one of the top 100 individual collectors in the U.S. ""An unknown quantity to most of the art world, Paul is no stranger to lavish spending,"" the magazine said, noting that he doesn't stop at paint on canvas but also spends big on art you can eat. ""He recently bid $30,000 at a Paris charity auction for a dinner cooked by six of the world's great chefs, but the final party cost closer to $100,000."" (Mr.
Paul says it wasn't that high.) 

The art collection might have come to rival the Medicis' had the Florida comptroller's office not got wind of Mr. Paul's aesthetic adventure. 

In its letter to him, dated March 2 and shared with reporters, Alex Hager, the chief of the thrift-institution bureau in the comptroller's office, expressed puzzlement that the S&L could be so profligate when it had reported losses of more than $13 million in its two preceding quarters. 

The state gave CenTrust 30 days to sell the Rubens.
The comptroller's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but broadened its demands, ordering that the ""book value of the collection {be} reduced to zero."" In other words: Get rid of all the pictures.
The state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the admonition to Mr. Paul: ""Govern yourself accordingly."" 

The state agency was particularly vexed to learn that the Rubens and a half-dozen other paintings listed among the bank's ""furniture and fixtures,"" were actually hanging in the chairman's house. 

Mr. Paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at Sotheby's.
He explains that he was ""merely storing the paintings at home -- with some display -- because of the special dehumidified environment"" required for their safekeeping, until CenTrust's new building was ready for them.
Still, the incident was embarrassing. 

It came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that Mr. Paul has benefited handsomely from his association with CenTrust.
For instance, he got a $3 million loan from the S&L, negotiated at a below-market rate.
He owns 43% of CenTrust's shares. 

Adding to Mr. Paul's problems, dealers (some with vested interests) insist that he, relying rather too heavily on Sotheby's advice, paid much too much for several pieces in the CenTrust collection.
The $12 million lavished on the Rubens, for example, was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value, given a dispute among scholars about its provenance.
David Tunick, the president of David Tunick Inc., a New York gallery, says scholars question the authenticity of the Rubens.
It may have been painted instead by a Rubens associate. 

""The feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event,"" Mr. Tunick says. ""It sounds like with the Rubens he got absolutely taken to the cleaners."" 

Victor Wiener, the executive director of the Appraisers Association of America, agrees that Mr. Paul paid very dearly for the Rubens and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat. ""It's not beyond credibility the Rubens will someday be worth $12 million, but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen."" 

Still, predicting is tricky. ""I'm forever dumbfounded by what I see making these high prices."" 

Jonathan H. Kress, the son of the painting's former owner, Mrs. Rush Kress, dismisses the price talk as ""sour grapes."" Dealers contemptuous of the purchase price, he says, were themselves interested in buying the Rubens but lost out. 

Mr. Paul, for his part, defends the Rubens price, saying a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself. ""Most of them weren't even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly,"" he says. 

Art prices are skyrocketing, but a good deal of legerdemain is involved in compiling statistics on sales.
Salomon Brothers Inc., the investment-banking firm, in its annual tally of investment returns, reported that old masters appreciated 51% in the year ended June 1, the greatest return of any of 13 assets it tracked. (Impressionist and modern paintings, not tracked by Salomon, are ranked even higher at 74% by Sotheby's.) 

Salomon, moreover, gets its data on art appreciation from Sotheby's, whose prices go up with clients like Mr. Paul in its thrall.
The percentages omit from consideration the many paintings that go begging at auction.
Art indexes track winners, not losers.
But art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale.
Also, at any of Sotheby's auctions of old masters, roughly one-third to one-fifth of what is offered doesn't sell at any price.
It's not that there aren't any bids, but the bids don't meet the minimum ""reserve"" prices set by the sellers. 

In January, the Preti painting that now hangs at CenTrust was expected to bring no more than $700,000 at auction until Mr. Paul came along with his $1.15 million. 

Mr. Hall of the Colnaghi gallery says $1.15 million ""would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a Preti four years ago."" But from his vantage point, it isn't that Mr. Paul, a customer of his too, overpaid for the work, ""a gargantuan painting by an artist who is not a household word."" (The painting is 10 feet wide, seven feet high.) Rather, ""It just shows things have changed."" 

Mr. Paul boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn. ""They went up 51% last year, and they'll do it again this year,"" he declares. ""They were a sleeper.
Everybody was out buying Monets."" Sotheby's vice president Diana Levitt says the auction house has been ""assisting"" Mr. Paul in selling the paintings.
And while Sotheby's chief rivals in the art world, private art dealers, ""won't be happy to hear it,"" she adds, ""a number of {the artworks} have already been sold, and at a substantial profit."" Mr. Paul claims to have sold three paintings, at more than a 10% profit.
That isn't 51%, and the claim isn't documented. 

He furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on Sotheby's or Mr. Wachter.
Mr. Paul says he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid impulsively.
After all, he had the counsel of ""curators from the most reputable museums in the world."" He says he expects to sell the collection -- including the controversial Rubens -- ""carefully and prudently, just as it was put together."" 

But in art-world parlance, Mr. Paul's holdings are ""burnt."" That is, he is being compelled to put them on the market too soon, and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works. ""After a few years, you can argue there has been natural appreciation,"" says Susan Theran, the publisher of Leonard's Annual Price Index of Art Auctions.
But quick turnover in artwork is ""like pawning your jewelry -- you end up with 50%.
People hold out and try to get a bargain."" 

Sotheby's defends itself and Mr. Paul in the matter.
Mr. Wachter says Mr. Paul was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment. ""On occasion, he paid a high price,"" Mr. Wachter concedes, but he says those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to resell them at a profit to collectors. 

Naomi Bernhard Levinson, a fine-arts appraiser at Bernhard Associates in San Francisco, considers it ""definite conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased."" Sotheby's, she says, is ""wearing both hats."" 

""I can't see why there would be a conflict of interest,"" says Sotheby's Ms. Levitt. ""Estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions, and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be."" Frequently, clients express interest in paintings but don't end up bidding, she adds, ""so we don't know who the potential buyer will be."" 

Mr. Paul, in selling off his paintings, is seeking at least a 15% return on the bank's investment, so as to prove that the venture was sound.
Mr. Paul says that he has feelers out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as Japan and Italy have examined the collection. 

Because of the pressure on CenTrust to sell, dealers and collectors have been trying to get the paintings at bargain-basement prices.
But so far, Mr. Paul and his advisers are holding fast. 

One dealer, Martin Zimet of French & Co. in New York, says he ""would have loved to buy"" a Jan Davids de Heem painting from the bank. ""I tried to steal the picture -- to buy it attractively -- and {Sotheby's} wouldn't do it.
They were protecting his interests."" 

Meanwhile, Mr. Paul and CenTrust executives are getting squeamish about opulence.
Mr. Paul has been characterized as ""the Great Gatsby or something,"" complains Karen E. Brinkman, an executive vice president of CenTrust.
The media, she says, have distorted his personal life. 

Mr. Paul nods in agreement. ""I don't think I have a life style that is, frankly, so flamboyant,"" he says.
But at just that moment, he is interrupted in his office by a servant in tuxedo who pours coffee from silver into a cup of china and dabs the brim with linen. 

Mr. Paul says, yes, the ceiling in his executive suite is gold-leaf inlay.
The offices are done in hardwood and oriental rugs, leatherbound books and, of course, a $12 million Rubens.
But he implores that the splendor be played down. 

""Don't say it's a gold ceiling.
Just say the offices are tastefully appointed,"" he says. ""Otherwise, the regulators will take it for decadence, and nowadays everything's got to be pristine.""

{During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.} 

CREATIVE ACCOUNTING, mostly by conglomerates, forced CPAs to change their way of setting standards to be followed by corporations reporting financial results, standards that had become all too flexible. 

The new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) was created in 1972 to replace the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
All of the former board's members were CPAs, provoking conflict-of-interest criticism because they were writing rules while handling clients' books at the same time. 

The new board's seven-member structure kept four CPAs, but the others were from industry and academia. 

Francis M. Wheat, a former Securities and Exchange Commission member, headed the panel that had studied the issues for a year and proposed the FASB on March 30, 1972.
The former board had produced ""21 opinions and 1,000 critics"" in its 12-year life, its chairman had conceded. 

The climate was right for the new FASB.
In the late 1960s some CPAs failed to correct such abuses as clients picking permissive rules that hyped earnings and stock prices.
And in November 1970 Congress had passed a special act to overrule one board rule.
Also, James Needham, an SEC commissioner, in April 1972 had warned that the industry might face a ""federal agency writing accounting rules"" if they rejected the FASB idea.
Keepers of the books, dubbed ""figure filberts,"" loathed the threat. 

The FASB had its initial meeting on March 28, 1973.
On Dec. 13, 1973, it issued its first rule; it required companies to disclose foreign currency translations in U.S. dollars.
The FASB since then has issued 102 rules, and some still rile industry.
Since late 1987, for example, it has put off a rule dealing with deferred income taxes because of the continuing controversy over the issue.

Reynolds Metals Co. said third-quarter net income dropped nearly 10% to $123.7 million, or $2.10 a share, from $137.2 million, or $2.56 a share, a year earlier.
The latest earnings reflect an increase of about 5.5 million in common shares outstanding.
Revenue rose 3% to $1.52 billion from $1.48 billion. 

Reynolds is the third big aluminum company since Friday to report disappointing earnings.
The No. 1 domestic aluminum producer, Aluminum Co. of America, Friday said its earnings fell 3.2% to $219 million, or $2.46 a share.
And Alcan Aluminium Ltd. yesterday reported net income slid 30% to $180 million, or 77 cents a share, from $258 million, or $1.07 a share.
Analysts on average had been expecting about $2.70 for Alcoa and $1 for Alcan. 

""It's a good indication that level of profitability has peaked for the industry,"" says Vahid Fathi, metals analyst with Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc., who had estimated Reynolds would earn about $2.35 a share. 

The nation's No. 2 aluminum company said earnings were hurt by lower prices for certain fabricated aluminum products, which typically follow price fluctuations of primary ingots.
The base metal price has dropped 30.3% from a year earlier to 78 cents a pound.
Much of the price decline has been blamed on a slowing economy and the third quarter is typically the industry's slowest period. 

But William O. Bourke, chairman and chief executive officer, said the ingot price ""appears to have bottomed out."" He said shipments are continuing at a ""healthy"" pace and the company has no excess inventory.
Aluminum shipments of 329,600 metric tons were nearly equal to the year-earlier period, the company said. 

Nevertheless, the company said that in the latest quarter there were increased material and labor costs, including a new employee profit-sharing plan. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Reynolds closed at $55.375, up $1.25.

No strikeout, but certainly no home run. 

That's how the stock-picking game is shaping up for the months ahead, according to money managers and a few brokers. 

Yesterday's 88-point recovery from Friday's megadrop in the Dow Jones industrials had many brokerage houses proclaiming that stocks are a good bargain again.
But quite a few money managers aren't buying it.
Weakening corporate earnings, they say, are no prescription for a bull market. 

""The stock market ain't going to do much of anything"" for a while, says John Neff of Wellington Management, who runs the $8.3 billion Windsor Fund.
He suspects that Friday's market decline may have a second leg, perhaps a 10% to 15% drop later on. 

Mr. Neff says the stock market has lost some powerful driving forces, namely earnings growth and the ""LBO sweepstakes"" -- buy-out fever that induced investors to bid up whole groups of stocks, such as media and airlines.
After sitting with 20% of his fund in cash before Friday's sell-off, Mr. Neff says he bought ""a narrow list of stocks"" yesterday. 

With flat corporate profits on the horizon for 1990, money managers say price-earnings multiples that look cheap today might go on being cheap for a long time. 

""This is not a grossly overvalued market, but it's not cheap either,"" says George Collins, president of the mutual fund company T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. 

According to Institutional Brokers Estimate System, Wall Street market strategists see only a 2.4% jump in company profits in 1990 -- unlike in 1987, when profits a year out looked good (they did soar 36% in 1988). 

Bulls say the market is an incredible bargain, priced at only about 12 times estimated 1989 earnings for stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index.
Before the 1987 crash, the P/E was more than 20. 

The common view, says Abby Cohen, strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert, is that there will be ""mild economic growth, modest profit expansion, and things are going to be hunky-dory.
Our view is that we may see a profit decline."" Some think investors should sell into rallies.
The market ""is going to wind down,"" says Gerald W. Perritt, a Chicago money manager. ""Things are a little less overpriced"" after Friday's jolt in the market.
He expects stocks to decline an additional 5% to 30%, with the Dow perhaps bottoming out between 2000 and 2100 ""between now and June."" 

After Friday's decline, Mr. Perritt's firm ran statistical tests on 100 high-quality stocks, using old-fashioned value criteria devised by Benjamin Graham, an analyst and author in the 1930s and 1940s who is widely considered to be the father of modern securities analysis.
He found 85 still overvalued and 15 fairly valued. 

Nicholas Parks, a New York money manager, expects the market to decline about 15%. ""I've been two-thirds in cash since July, and I continue to think that having a defensive position is appropriate,"" he says.
Companies that piled on debt in leveraged buy-outs during the past two years ""will continue to surface as business problems."" 

""Generalizations about value aren't useful,"" says New York money manager John LeFrere of Delta Capital Management.
For instance, he says, International Business Machines and Unisys might look cheap, but investors might continue to do better with stocks like Walt Disney, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola, strong performers in recent years. 

Money manager Robert Ross, head of Duncan Ross Associates Ltd. in Vancouver, British Columbia, says stocks would have to fall 15% to 20% before they are competitive with less risky investment alternatives.
Fredric Russell, a money manager in Tulsa, Okla., says Friday's cave-in ""is going to have more of a permanent impact on the psyche of many investors than Wall Street would want to admit."" 

There are still bulls out there. ""I still think we will have a 3000 Dow, whether it's six months or 12 months from now I don't know,"" says David Dreman, managing partner of Dreman Value Management in New York. ""We're doing a little buying"" in some stocks ""that have really been smashed down."" 

Many brokerage house officials also are optimistic.
Yesterday, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter all increased the proportion of assets they recommend investors commit to stocks.
Dean Witter now recommends 85%, Goldman 65% and Merrill Lynch 50%. 

Some investors say Friday's sell-off was a good thing, because it deflated a lot of crazy takeover speculation. ""It was a healthy cleansing,"" says Michael Holland, who runs Salomon Brothers Asset Management in New York. 

From here out, these investors see a return to old-fashioned investing, based on a company's ability to show profit growth. 

""The fundamentals are pretty strong,"" Mr. Dreman says. ""I don't see this as a bear market at all.
It's a recognition that there was much too much fluff in the LBO market."" 

Friday's big fall was ""just a blunder by the stock market,"" says John Connolly, chief strategist for Dean Witter. ""It was an overreaction to an event {the failure of a management and union group to get bank financing for a takeover of UAL} that doesn't mean that much to lots of stocks."" Many investors have nagging worries, however.
Newspapers are full of headlines about companies defaulting on their debts and banks writing off real estate loans.
That hurts investors' confidence in the economy and stocks. 

Not even all the brokerage firms see clear sailing ahead. ""Disappointing profits are likely to get worse in the next two quarters,"" says Mary Farrell, a market strategist at PaineWebber.
She thinks the market could drop about 10% in the next few months, then recover and go higher.
Companies with steady earnings growth could do well, she says, while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline far more than 10%.

The turmoil on Wall Street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and department-store chains, investment bankers and retailers said. 

Managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend to bid for their companies.
The chains include Bloomingdale's, owned by Campeau Corp., Toronto; Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's, owned by B.A.T Industries PLC, London; and B. Altman & Co. and Sakowitz Inc., owned by Hooker Corp., which is now being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator.
Hooker is based in Sydney, Australia. 

The combination of so many chains available for sale, the recent failures of such retailing LBO's as Miller & Rhoads Inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices, retailing observers said. 

""The pricing will become more realistic, which should help management,"" said Bruce Rosenthal, a New York investment banker with Nathan S. Jonas & Co. ""Investors aren't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed LBOs, but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense, either."" 

Earlier this year, bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales, Mr. Rosenthal added.
Those days are over now, he believes. 

""Competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue,"" added Mr. Rosenthal. ""But when prices were crazy, it was even harder to do an LBO. Bankers believed in the greater-fool theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more.
This is no longer true today."" 

At Saks Fifth Avenue, Paul Leblang, senior vice president, marketing, agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed LBO. 

""Having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage,"" said Mr. Leblang. ""It would also help us in our search for equity partners.
To make an LBO work, now we are going to need more than just junk bonds."" None believe the proposed management LBOs will be easy to complete, especially at B. Altman & Co., which is under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Not only could the Wall Street gyrations damp Christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy, but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger covenants and greater management equity participation. 

Further, many institutions today holding troubled retailers' debt securities will be reticent to consider additional retailing investments. ""It's called bad money driving out good money,"" said one retailing observer. ""Institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned."" 

However, the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt.
In addition, the fall selling season has generally been a good one, especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues. 

""What's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings, not liquidation values,"" said Joseph E. Brooks, chairman and chief executive officer of Ann Taylor Inc., a specialty chain. ""Retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies."" 

Still, most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing LBOs will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds, a market already in tumult, in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the Federated and Allied units of Campeau. 

""Prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week, which will help management,"" said Gilbert Harrison, chairman of Financo Inc., an investment-banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions. ""But the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved.
Potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management, or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past.""

A federal appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers part of $1 billion in costs from controversial ""take-or-pay"" contracts. 

The court, in a 3-0 ruling, threw out a deadline set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but didn't use. 

FERC's regulation had given pipelines until March 31, 1989, to pass on to customers as much as 50% of the costs of buying out their broken contracts, which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short. 

A majority of old contracts were renegotiated by the deadline and settled at steep discounts.
But pipeline companies estimate they still face $2.4 billion in liabilities from unresolved disputes, including $1 billion they fear they won't be able to pass on to customers. 

According to industry lawyers, the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism.
The court left open whether FERC could reimpose a new deadline later. 

The court, agreeing with pipeline companies, found the March 31 deadline was ""arbitrary and capricious"" and ""highly prejudicial to the bargaining power of pipelines"" that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old take-or-pay contracts to meet the deadline. 

A report last month by the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America found that pipelines' settlement costs had jumped in the three months before the deadline to 39 cents on the dollar, from 22 cents on the dollar in 1988. 

The court ordered FERC to justify within 60 days not only its cost-sharing deadline, but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural-gas transportation.
The court also questioned a crediting mechanism that could be used to resolve take-or-pay liabilities. 

The complex regulation, known in the industry as Order 500, has been hotly contested by all sides, including natural-gas producers, pipelines, local distribution companies and consumers.
The court's decision would allow FERC to change some of its provisions, but ensures it will be reviewed again quickly by the court.

A battle is raging in Venice over plans to have the 1,200-year-old Italian city be the site for a universal exposition in 2000.

Angel Gurria, Mexico's top debt negotiator, said the country's creditor banks are responding positively to Mexico's debt-reduction package. 

Mr. Gurria's optimism contrasts with some bankers' views that the deal may require a lot of arm twisting by the U.S. Treasury in order to succeed.
Mr. Gurria, Mexico's under-secretary of the ministry of finance, met yesterday with European bankers in London, at the half-way point on a so-called road show to market the package around the world. 

An increasing number of banks appear to be considering the option under the deal whereby they can swap their Mexican loans for 30-year bonds with a face value discounted by 35%, Mr. Gurria said.
The other two options consist of swapping loans for bonds with 6.25% interest rates, or providing fresh loans. 

The accord, which covers $52.7 billion of Mexico's medium- and long-term debt, is expected to go into effect in early

Korean car exports have slid about 40% so far this year, but auto makers here aren't panicking. 

They are enjoying domestic sales that are more than making up for lost overseas sales.
South Korean consumers are expected to buy almost 500,000 passenger cars this year, up 60% from 1988.
In fact, some auto executives suggest that slackened demand for their cars in the U.S. and Canada is a blessing; otherwise they wouldn't be able to keep up with demand in the more profitable local market. 

""We are very lucky to easily change an export loss to domestic plus,"" says Hong Tu Pyo, managing director of domestic marketing for Hyundai Motor Co. 

As it is, waiting lists of a month aren't unusual for popular models.
Demand is so strong that all of the domestic makers -- Hyundai, Kia Motors Corp., Daewoo Motor Co. and even upstart SsangYong Motor Co. -- plan to build more factories.
Industry analysts predict that by 1995, South Korea will be building three million cars a year -- about half of that for export. 

It's an optimistic move in a industry already facing world-wide overcapacity.
But South Korean auto makers are confident that the export market will bounce back and that demand in Korea will stay strong.
Currently only one in 38 South Koreans owns a car, up from one in 200 a decade ago. ""In the year 2000 it will be one car per family.
At that point domestic sales will slow down,"" says Kim Yoon Kwon, director of marketing for Daewoo Motor. 

The reason for the tremendous demand is simple: South Koreans suddenly have a lot more money. ""We never thought we'd own a car,"" says Kwang Ok Kyong, who just bought a Daewoo LeMans on a five-year loan.
She and her husband started a small printing business and need the car for work as well as for weekend jaunts. 

Pay raises of 60% over the past three years have given many South Koreans the money to enjoy the things they were supplying the rest of the world.
The success of newcomer SsangYong Motor shows the strength of the auto market and its growing diversity.
A part of the construction-oriented conglomerate SsangYong Group, it took over the dying Dong-A Motor Co. in 1986.
SsangYong began making variations of the Jeep-like ""Korando"" vehicle. (Dong-A had had a technology agreement with Jeep maker American Motors Corp., now a part of Chrysler Corp.) The most popular style is the stretched ""Family,"" which resembles a Ford Bronco or Chevy Blazer.
The four-wheel-drive vehicles start at $15,000; a Family can cost over $25,000. 

SsangYong, which has only about 3% of the domestic market, will sell about 18,000 of its models this year, twice as many as last year.
It sees sales rising 45% to 26,000 units next year. 

The company plans to expand plant capacity 50% by 1991.
By then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger car based on the Volvo 240 and selling for about $20,000. 

Hyundai and Daewoo seem unconcerned about the SsangYong threat, but Kia, the scrappy No.3 auto maker, is selling four-wheel-drive vehicles through its Asia unit.
It plans to sell 1,700 units in 1989. 

Kia, the only Korean car maker that has seen its overseas sales grow in 1989, aims at Korea's common man.
Its advantage has been the peppy little Pride, sold as the Ford Festiva in the U.S.
At 3.8 million won, or $5,700, the econobox is the lowest-priced car in South Korea.
Along with two larger models, the company claims 18% of the domestic market.
Ford Motor Co. and Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. have equity interests in Kia. 

Kia is the most aggressive of the Korean Big Three in offering financing.
Loans for as long as five years make the cars very accessible, with monthly payments as low as 80,000 won, or $120. 

Daewoo Motor, a 50-50 joint venture with General Motors Corp. and the Daewoo Group conglomerate, is the only auto maker that appears to be hurting.
Shipments of its Lemans to GM's Pontiac division are off about 65% from a year ago, versus a 44% decline for Hyundai and an 18% increase for Kia.
Moreover, Daewoo's domestic sales have grown half as fast as sales of its rivals. 

The big problem for Daewoo, which holds about 21% of the market, is the long series of labor disruptions it suffered this year.
But Daewoo is expanding too.
In fact, a sister company, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery, plans to build 240,000 minicars by the mid-1990s. 

Hyundai, the Korean market leader with a 58% share, also plans to jump into minicars at the same time.
It has a similar project for 200,000 cars a year.
Kia is reportedly also considering such a plan.
Even giant Samsung Group is rumored in the Korean press to be considering getting into the auto-making business; a company spokesman had no comment.

Many skittish mutual fund investors picked up the phone yesterday, but decided not to cash in their chips after all. 

As the stock market bounced back, withdrawals of money from stock funds amounted to a mere trickle compared with Black Monday, when investors dumped $2.3 billion, or about 2% of stock-fund assets. 

Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest fund company, said phone volume was more than double its typical level, but still half that of Oct. 19, 1987.
Net outflows from Fidelity's stock funds stood at less than $300 million, or below 15% of the $2 billion cash position of the firm's stock portfolios.
Much of the money was switched into the firm's money market funds.
Outflows since the close of trading Friday remain below one-third their level of two years ago, Fidelity said. 

Other mutual fund companies reported even lighter withdrawal requests.
And some investors at Fidelity and elsewhere even began buying stock funds during the day. 

""Two years ago, there was a lot of redemption activity and trouble with people getting through on the phone,"" said Kathryn McGrath, head of the investment management division of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
This time, ""We don't have that at all."" 

Of course, the relative calm could be jolted if the market plunges again.
And any strong surge in redemptions could force some funds to dump stocks to raise cash, as some did during Black Monday. 

But funds generally are better prepared this time around.
As a group, their cash position of 10.2% of assets in August -- the latest figure available -- is 14% higher than two years earlier.
Many fund managers have boosted their cash levels in recent weeks. 

The biggest flurry of investor activity came early in the day.
Vanguard Group Inc. saw heavy exchanges from stock funds into money market funds after the telephone lines opened at 8:30 a.m. ""In the first hour, the real nervous folks came along,"" a spokesman said. ""But the horrendous pace of call volume in the first half-hour slowed considerably."" 

At Scudder, Stevens & Clark Inc., phone calls came in at 40% more than the normal pace through early afternoon.
Most of that increase came in the first hour after the phone lines opened at 8 a.m. 

As stocks rose, in fact, some investors changed course and reversed their sell orders.
Many funds allow investors to void orders before the close of trading. 

At Scudder and at the smaller Ivy funds group in Hingham, Mass., for instance, some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds, but later called back to reverse the switches.
Because mutual fund trades don't take effect until the market close -- in this case, at 4 p.m. -- these shareholders effectively stayed put. 

At Fidelity's office in downtown Boston, Gerald Sherman walked in shortly after 7:30 a.m. and placed an order to switch his retirement accounts out of three stock funds and into a money market fund.
But by 3:15 p.m., with the market comfortably ahead for the day, Mr. Sherman was preparing to undo his switch. 

""It's a nice feeling to know that things stabilized,"" said Mr. Sherman, the 51-year-old co-owner of a discount department store. 

But some investors continued to switch out of high-risk, high-yield junk funds despite yesterday's rebound from that market's recent price declines. 

Shareholders have been steadily bailing out of several big junk funds the past several weeks as the $200 billion market was jolted by a cash crunch at Campeau Corp. and steadily declining prices.
Much of the money has been switched into money market funds, fund executives say. 

Instead of selling bonds to meet redemptions, however, some funds have borrowed from banks to meet withdrawal requests.
This avoids knocking down prices further.
The $1.1 billion T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund was among the funds that borrowed during the Campeau crisis, says George J. Collins, president of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. 

That way, Mr. Collins says, ""We didn't have to sell securities in a sloppy market."" When the market stabilized, he added, the firm sold the bonds and quickly paid the loans back.

(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

SOFT CONTACT LENSES WON federal blessing on March 18, 1971, and quickly became eye openers for their makers. 

The Food and Drug Administration that day said Bausch & Lomb could start selling them in the U.S.
The cornflake-size product was more comfortable and less prone to falling out than hard contact lenses, which had been around since 1939.
Bausch & Lomb sold the softies under a sublicense from National Patent Development, which had gained the rights from the Czechoslovakia Academy of Sciences.
Otto Wichterle, a Czech, invented them in 1962. 

The plastic lens wraps itself over the cornea, absorbing eye moisture while permitting oxygen to pass through. 

But the new lens became the eye of a storm.
In September 1971 California officials seized ""bootlegged"" lenses -- made by unlicensed companies -- after some showed traces of bacteria.
In October doctors were debating the product's safety, some claiming it caused infections.
And there were Senate hearings on the questions in July 1972.
The product overcame the bad publicity and kept evolving. 

The early soft lenses, which cost $300 a set, were expected to last for a year.
In 1983 ""extended wear"" versions, designed to be worn for 30 days at a time, wree offered.
Eighteen months ago a ""disposable"" seven-day model bowed; a year's supply costs about $500. 

Last month the FDA and Contact Lens Institute cautioned users that serious eye infections could result from wearing lenses more than seven days at a stretch. 

Today 20 million of the 25 million Americans using contact lenses are using the soft type.
Including the accesory eye care products, contacts account for $2 billion in annual retail sales.
Although Bausch remains the leader among the six majors, Johnson & Johnson, with its new disposables, is coming on fast.

The roller-coaster stock market is making life tougher for small companies trying to raise money. 

In the wake of Friday's plunge and yesterday's rebound, some companies are already postponing deals, and others wish they could.
As in other jittery times, many small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors shun risky deals, seeking safety in bigger companies. 

Even if stock prices fully recover from Friday's sharp decline, the unsettled conditions will frighten many investors. 

""The implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically,"" says Henry Linsert Jr., chairman of Martek Corp., a four-year-old biotechnology company that is planning a private placement of stock. ""The more variables that indicate risk, the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain."" 

Earlier this month, Staples Inc., a Newton, Mass., office-supplies discounter, said it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the public.
At the time, its shares were selling above their initial offering price of $19, and bankers believed Staples would sell new stock without a hitch. 

But with the company's shares standing at $15 yesterday, a new offering seems unlikely, company officials say.
Business, however, continues to be ""robust,"" and the stock market hasn't affected the concern's expansion plans, says Todd Krasnow, a senior executive. 

Other companies figure they can't avoid the market. ""We have capital requirements,"" says Mr. Linsert, ""so we have to go ahead"" with a planned $1.5 billion private placement.
Unless the market goes right back up, he says, ""it may take us six to nine months to find the money, instead of three."" And the Columbia, Md., company may have to settle for a lower price, he adds. 

Life is particularly nerve-racking for companies that had planned to go public this week.
Hand-holding is becoming an investment-banking job requirement. 

Robertson, Stephens & Co., a San Francisco investment banking concern, has a client that looked forward to making its initial public offering yesterday.
Officers of the company, a health-care concern, ""were very discouraged on Friday and felt they shouldn't go public; we felt they should,"" says Sanford Robertson, partner in the banking concern. 

As the market dropped Friday, Robertson Stephens slashed the value of the offering by 7%.
Yesterday, when similar securities rebounded, it bumped the valuation up again.
As of late yesterday, the IPO was still on. 

For many, the situation is especially discouraging because the market for IPOs was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness. ""We were just beginning to look at the increase in IPOs, seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Frank Kline Jr., partner in Lambda Funds, a Beverly Hills, Calif., venture capital concern. ""But the tunnel's just gotten longer."" 

Companies planning to go public ""are definitely taking a second look,"" says Allen Hadhazy, senior analyst at the Institute for Econometric Research, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which publishes the New Issues newsletter on IPOs.
He calculates that the recent market slide translated into a 5% to 7% reduction in IPO proceeds to companies. 

Many companies are hesitating.
Exabyte Corp. had been planning to sell 10% of its stock this week in an IPO that would raise up to $28.5 million.
But now, Peter Behrendt, president, says, ""We're making decisions on a day-to-day basis."" Debt-free and profitable, the Boulder, Colo., computer-products concern could borrow funds if it decides against an IPO now, he says. 

KnowledgeWare Inc., an Atlanta computer-software concern, says it is still planning to go ahead with its IPO this week or next -- unless conditions change. ""It's a wait-and-see situation right now,"" says Terry McGowan, president. 

Delayed financings also would affect the operations of many companies.
Sierra Tucson Cos., a Tucson, Ariz., operator of addiction-treatment centers, has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an IPO scheduled for next week.
William O'Donnell, president, says he still thinks the IPO will succeed.
If it doesn't, he says, the company would have to change its expansion timetable. 

But the market turmoil could be partially beneficial for some small businesses.
In a sagging market, the Federal Reserve System ""might flood the market with funds, and that should bring interest rates down,"" says Leonard T. Anctil, vice president of the Bank of New England, Boston. 

James G. Zafris, president of Danvers Savings Bank, Danvers, Mass., says the market turmoil ""is an absolute non-event for small business."" For small companies, he says, interest rates are far more important than what happens on stock exchanges.
Mr. Zafris thinks rates are heading down, helping small companies. 

Peter Drake, biotechnology analyst for Vector Securities International, Chicago, thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations.
Partly because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing, many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently.
Some even see a silver lining in the dark clouds.
Alan Wells, president of Bollinger, Wells, Lett & Co., a New York merger specialist, thinks panicky investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy-out and giant takeover deals.
Instead, they could turn to investing in smaller deals involving smaller companies, he says. 

And William E. Wetzel Jr., a University of New Hampshire management professor and director of Venture Capital Network Inc., says the market's gyrations will underline the investors' lack of control in big stock investments.
This will add to the appeal of small business, he says, where investors often have a degree of influence.

Bay Financial Corp., hurt by high debts and deteriorating real estate investments, reported a wider loss for the fourth quarter and said it might be forced to seek a bankruptcy-court reorganization if it can't renegotiate its borrowings. 

Bay said a ""substantial part"" of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower-than-expected prices for sales made.
The company said its real estate portfolio is ""highly leveraged,"" while about two-thirds of its investments aren't income-producing.
Thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments. 

According to its latest annual report, about a quarter of the company's holdings are in Massachusetts, in the midst of a real-estate slump. 

The company said it had a net loss in its fourth quarter ended June 30 of $36.2 million, or $9.33 a share, on revenue of $13.1 million.
A year earlier, the company had a loss of $10.8 million, or $3.04 a share, on revenue of $10.8 million.
For the year, it had a net loss of $62 million, or $15.97 a share, on revenue of $44.3 million.
In the previous year, it had a loss of $22.5 million, or $6.52 a share, on revenue of $41.1 million. 

Although it is having serious cash-flow problems, Bay said the fair-market value of its holdings, minus debt, was equal to $6.02 a share at June 30 based on a recent appraisal.
Book value per share, which is based on investments at cost, was a negative $6.69 a share.
A year earlier, fair-market value per share was $26.02 and book value was $9.43 a share.

TRW Inc. reported a 12% decline in third-quarter net income, but the company said that excluding unusual gains in both quarters, operating profit rose 16%. 

The electronics, automotive and aerospace concern said third-quarter net was $60 million, or 98 cents a share, down from $68 million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier.
Share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis, by company tradition. 

Results for the 1988 quarter included a gain of $1.05 a share from sale of the Reda Pump and Oilwell Cable units, partly offset by a charge of 69 cents a share for recall of faulty truck steering systems.
The latest quarter included a gain of 11 cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge, because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs. 

Sales for the quarter rose 8.3% to $1.79 billion, from $1.65 billion, with all three major product groups reporting gains. 

The company said aerospace and defense sales were up 2% for the quarter to $802 million, and operating profit climbed 6% to $61 million, mainly because of improved program performance in spacecraft and advanced-technology contracts. 

Automotive sales jumped 16% to $791 million, mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems, TRW said.
The group had an operating profit of $65 million, against a loss of $13 million a year earlier.
However, excluding the year-earlier charge for recall of steering gear, operating profit in the latest quarter declined 14%, reflecting higher start-up and product development expenses in passenger-restraint systems.
Materials and production costs also rose, TRW said. 

The information systems segment had a 44% jump sales to $196 million.
An acquisition accounted for half the sales rise, TRW said.
Operating profit rose threefold to $18 million, from $6 million. 

For the nine months, TRW's net was $199 million, or $3.22 a share, down 3% from $205 million, or $3.33 a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 2.9% to $5.42 billion, from $5.27 billion.

a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic, not unheroic, though sadly self-deceived English butler in his sixties -- proceeds as if the realistic English novel of manners, like Britannia herself, still ruled the waves.
In fact, Kazuo Ishiguro's ""The Remains of the Day"" (Knopf, 245 pages, $18.95) is both an homage to traditional English forms and a dramatic critique of them.
It implies that the British Empire was rooted in its subjects' minds, manners and morals, and argues, tacitly, that its self-destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery, willful blindness, role-playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants. 

As the narrator Stevens, the solitary butler of Darlington Hall, mulls over such hallowed terms as ""greatness,"" ""dignity,"" ""service"" and ""loyalty,"" we see how pious cant subverts the soul.
Stevens's dutiful conflation of the public and private realms -- like his beloved master's -- destroys all it was designed to preserve.
Such armor crushes the soldier.
The mask cuts to the quick. 

It's 1956, the year the Suez crisis marked the final end of Empire.
As he stands on a hill at the beginning of a six-day motor expedition from Oxfordshire to Cornwall, where a former housekeeper resides, perhaps the victim of an unhappy 20-year marriage, perhaps (he hopes with more fervor than he will ever acknowledge) not disinclined to return to domestic service, Stevens surveys the view and thereby provides a self-portrait, a credo and the author's metaphor for the aesthetic of the novel we're reading: 

""We call this land of ours Great Britain, and there may be those who believe this a somewhat immodest practice.
Yet I would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective. . . . It is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart.
What is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty, its sense of restraint.
It is as though the land knows of its own beauty, of its own greatness, and feels no need to shout it.
In comparison, the sorts of sights offered in such places as Africa and America, though undoubtedly very exciting, would, I am sure, strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness."" 

An effusive landscape?
An ill-mannered mountain?
But let Stevens continue in his unwitting comic manner (his conscious efforts at ""banter"" always fail -- most comically): ""This whole question is very akin to the question that has caused much debate in our profession over the years: what is a `great' butler?"" His answer is one ""possessed of a dignity in keeping with his position."" Such dignity ""has to do crucially with a butler's ability not to abandon the professional being he inhabits."" He ""will not be shaken out by external events, however surprising, alarming or vexing. . . . Continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the English race are capable of."" 

Despite his racial advantage, to be a great butler is a heroic calling; one's pantry is ""not unlike general's headquarters during a battle."" If, for example, in the midst of a great social occasion (such as an international conference on revising the Versailles Treaty in 1923), one's 72-yearold father, himself a great butler once, should happen to die of a stroke, one must continue to serve the port: ""Please don't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment.
You see, I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now."" It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows Stevens to declare: ""For all its sad associations, whenever I recall that evening today, I find I do so with a large sense of triumph."" We note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow.
That Stevens himself is not grotesque or repellent, but funny and sad and enlightening, is entirely the author's triumph. 

Mr. Ishiguro's ability to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic, cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel, ""An Artist of the Floating World,"" set in Japan after the war.
Now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the England he has lived in for nearly 30 years, he has fashioned a novel in the mode of Henry James and E.M. Forster.
With great aplomb he considers not only filial devotion and (utterly repressed) sexual love, but British anti-Semitism, the gentry's impatience with democracy and support of Hitler, and the moral problematics of loyalty: ""It is, in practice, simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same time provide good service. . . . `This employer embodies all that I find noble and admirable.
I will hereafter devote myself to serving him. ' This is loyalty intelligently bestowed."" 

In the end, after meeting with the former housekeeper, Stevens sits by the seashore at dusk, thinking of her and of his employer, and declares ""I trusted.
I trusted in his lordship's wisdom. . . . I can't even say I made my own mistakes.
Really -- one has to ask oneself -- what dignity is there in that?"" The loyal servant has come full circle.
What is greatness?
What is dignity?
We understand such rueful wisdom must be retrospective: The owl of Minerva only spreads her wings at dusk.
But as ""The Remains of the Day"" so eloquently demonstrates with quiet virtuosity, such wisdom can be movingly embodied in art.

Stanislav Ovcharenko, who represents the Soviet airline Aeroflot here, has some visions that are wild even by the current standards of perestroika. 

In his office overlooking the runway of Shannon Airport, Mr. Ovcharenko enthusiastically throws out what he calls ""just ideas"": 

First, he suggests, GPA Group Ltd., the international aircraft leasing company based in Ireland, could lease some of its Boeing jetliners to the Soviet airline.
Then Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, could teach Aeroflot pilots to fly the Boeings, and the fleet could be based here at Shannon Airport. 

That's not all, he says.
Aer Rianta, the Irish airport authority, could build a cargo terminal in the Soviet Union.
Aeroflot could lease some of its cargo planes to Aer Lingus, through GPA, for a joint-venture cargo airline.
And then there is his notion of an Irish-Soviet charter airline to ferry Armenians to Los Angeles via Shannon. 

Have the freedoms of glasnost gone to Mr. Ovcharenko's head? 

Hardly.
The Irish-Soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at Shannon Airport.
GPA is indeed talking about leasing Western planes to Aeroflot and even about buying Soviet-built Tupolev 204s.
Aer Lingus is in discussions with the Soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities.
Aer Rianta already has so many ventures with Aeroflot that its chief executive is studying Russian. 

Unlikely as it may seem, tiny, politically neutral Ireland has penetrated the mighty Soviet airline bureaucracy.
And as Aeroflot struggles to boost its service standards, upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities, the Irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit. 

""Irish and Soviet people are similar,"" says Mr. Ovcharenko. ""They look the same.
They're very friendly."" Moreover, he says, Irish companies are small but spunky. ""We have to study their experience very well,"" he says. ""We must find any way to get business."" The two groups have been working together since the late 1970s, long before Soviet joint ventures were the rage in the West.
Aeroflot carried about 125 million passengers last year, and Shannon Airport, the airline's largest transit airport outside the Soviet Union, saw 1,400 Aeroflot flights and 250,000 passengers pass through.
An apartment complex down the road is the crew-rest and staging area for more than 130 Aeroflot pilots and flight attendants. 

The airport's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the Soviet Union.
Tankers from the Latvian port of Ventspils each year unload 25 million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport.
What Aeroflot doesn't pour into its own gas-guzzling Ilyushins is bartered to the airport authority, which resells it to 11 Western carriers including Air France, Trans World Airlines and Pakistan International Airlines.
Aeroflot thus pays its landing fees, ground-handling and catering bills with fuel, preserving its hard currency. 

That isn't all.
Last year, the Irish airport authority, in a joint venture with Aeroflot, opened four hard-currency duty-free shops at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport.
Aer Rianta now manages duty-free sales on all Aeroflot international flights out of Moscow.
Duty-free shops in Leningrad's Pulkova Airport opened in July, and hard-currency shops in Leningrad hotels and on the Soviet-Finnish frontier are coming soon. 

Aer Rianta is talking about similar joint ventures in Tashkent and in Sochi, a Black Sea resort, and even has a computer-assembly project cooking with the Georgian city of Tbilisi. 

Aeroflot's international fleet of 285 planes is being repainted and refurbished at Shannon Airport.
Thanks to a new air-traffic agreement and the ability of Irish travel agents to issue Aeroflot tickets, tourists here are taking advantage of Aeroflot's reasonable prices to board flights in Shannon for holidays in Havana, Kingston and Mexico City.
The round-trip fare to Havana is 410 Irish punts ($578).
Jamaica costs 504 punts. 

A formal blessing of sorts was bestowed on this friendship in April when Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev stopped here for talks with Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey.
New trade accords were signed. 

It all started with geography.
When it opened in 1939, Shannon was the first landfall in Europe for thirsty airplanes flying from North America.
Advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a Shannon stop unnecessary for most Western air fleets, but Aeroflot still flies inefficient Ilyushins that can't make it from Moscow to Managua on one hop. 

As a result, Ireland didn't spurn the Soviets after they shot down a Korean Air Lines jetliner over the Sea of Japan in 1983, though it suspended direct Moscow-Shannon flights for two months.
In fact, Aer Lingus started ferrying Russians from Shannon to New York when Washington stripped Aeroflot of its U.S. landing rights. 

Today, Aer Rianta is making a heap of money from its Soviet friendship.
And, with those contacts in place, it could be relatively simple to add Aer Lingus and GPA to the team.
Then, perhaps, Mr. Ovcharenko's ideas wouldn't sound like so much blarney.

Britain's industrial production rose 1.5% in August from July and was up 0.9% from August 1988, according to provisional data from the Central Statistical Office. 

Output in the energy sector, which can vary greatly with swings in the oil market, rose 3.8% in August from May but was down 7.1% from a year earlier.
The latest figures compare with July's 4.5% month-to-month rise and 11.3% year-to-year fall.

When Nucor Corp. begins shipping steel from the world's first thin-slab plant this month, it will begin testing the competitive mettle of its giant competitors. 

The new technology, which creates a very thin piece of steel, radically reduces the costs of making flat-rolled sheets.
An ebullient Kenneth Iverson, Nucor's chairman, says the company's plant eventually will make a ton of steel in 1.5 man hours, compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill. 

""We've had the Russians and Chinese, and people from India visiting us,"" Mr. Iverson beams. ""Everyone in the world is watching us very closely."" 

Especially his neighbors, the major U.S. steelmakers.
Already, USX Corp. and Armco Inc. are studying Nucor's technology to see if they can adopt it.
Says the chief executive officer of a major Midwest steel company: ""It's damn worrisome."" 

The once-staid steel industry is about to be turned topsy-turvy by a 1990s technology revolution.
New, efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller, less cash-rich companies to make steel at a fraction of what Big Steel paid decades ago.
It also enables minimills finally to get a toehold in the flat-rolled steel market -- the major steelmakers' largest, most prized, and until now, untouchable, market. 

But such thin-slab technology is only the beginning.
Eager engineers espouse direct-steelmaking and direct casting, which by the end of the 1990s will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces.
Those massive structures, while posing cost and environmental headaches, effectively locked out all but deep-pocketed giants from steelmaking. 

""There's a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way we market and distribute steel,"" says William Dennis, vice president, manufacturing and technology, for the American Iron Ore and Steel Institute. 

It isn't that major steelmakers have blithely ignored high technology.
In fact, they've spent billions of dollars to boost the percentage of continously cast steel to 60.9% in 1988, from 39.6% five years before.
Moreover, their balance sheets are rich with diversity, their old plants shuttered, and work forces lean. 

But that won't suffice. ""It's no longer enough to beat the guy down the street.
You have to beat everyone around the world,"" says Mr. Dennis.
He wants to see steelmakers more involved in computers and artificial intelligence. 

The problem: They're saddled with huge plants that require costly maintenance.
And try plying new dollars free in a market that is softening, hurt by a strong dollar and concerned about overcapacity -- the industry's Darth Vadar. 

""The technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established producers,"" says Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. ""They've got too much invested in the old stuff and they can't get their workers to be flexible."" 

No one expects minimills to eclipse major integrated steelmakers, who remain the undisputed kings of highest-quality steel used for autos and refrigerators.
Nucor's plant in Crawfordsville, Ind., ultimately will produce only one million tons annually, a drop in the 40-million-ton-a-year flat-rolled steel bucket, and it will be years before such plants can compete in the high-profit market.
Still, flat-rolled is the steel industry's bread and butter, representing about half of the 80 million tons of steel expected to be shipped this year. 

Moreover, the process isn't without its headaches.
Because all operations are connected, one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown.
On some days, the Nucor plant doesn't produce anything. 

""At this point, the minimill capacity won't make a great dent in the integrated market, but it does challenge them to develop new markets,"" says James McCall, vice president, materials, at Battelle, a technology and management-research giant based in Columbus, Ohio. 

Indeed, with demand for steel not growing fast enough to absorb capacity, steelmakers will have to change the way they do business.
In the past, says Armco's chief economist John Corey, steelmakers made a product and set it out on the loading dock. ""We said: `We've got a product: if you want it, you can buy it, '"" he says, adding: ""Now we're figuring out what people need, and are going back to make it."" 

Armco's sales representatives visit the General Motors Corp. 's Fairfax assembly plant in Kansas City, Mo., two or three days a week.
When they determined that GM needed parts more quickly, Armco convinced a steel service center to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered within 15 minutes. 

Cementing such relationships with major clients -- car and appliance makers -- is a means of survival, especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers. 

For example, when Detroit began talking about plastic-bodied cars, the American Iron and Steel Institute began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled. 

But steelmakers must also find new markets.
After letting aluminum-makers take the recycling lead, a group of the nation's largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious nation. 

Battelle's Mr. McCall thinks steelmakers should concentrate more on construction.
Weirton Steel Corp., Weirton, W. Va., for example, is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors, with leaded glass inserts, as a secure and energy-efficient alternative to wooden or aluminum ones.
Other steelmakers envision steel roofs covering suburbia. 

Still others are looking at overseas markets.
USX is funneling drilling pipe to steel-hungry Soviet Union.
This year, the nation's largest steelmaker reactivated its overseas sales operation. 

Producers also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher-profit output, such as coated and electrogalvanized products, which remain beyond the reach of minimills.
Almost all capital-improvement programs announced by major steelmakers within the past year involve building electrogalvanizing lines, used to produce steel for such products as household appliances and car doors. 

But unfortunately, that segment is much smaller than the bread-and-butter flat-rolled steel. ""It's like everyone climbing out of the QE II and getting into a lifeboat,"" says John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants. ""After a while, someone has to go over the side."" Although he doesn't expect any bankruptcies, he does see more plants being sold or closed. 

Robert Crandall, with the Brookings Institute, agrees. ""Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar, it's unlikely that consumption of U.S. produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills."" 

Not to mention the incursion of imports.
Japanese and European steelmakers, which have led the recent technology developments, are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in 1992.
Moreover, the U.S. can expect more competition from low-cost producing Pacific Rim and Latin American countries.
A Taiwanese steelmaker recently announced plans to build a Nucor-like plant. 

""People think of the steel business as an old and mundane smokestack business,"" says Mr. Iverson. ""They're dead wrong.""

Polaroid Corp. 's patent-infringement damages case against Eastman Kodak Co., one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever, is getting scant attention on Wall Street. 

After 78 days of mind-numbing testimony in federal court in Boston, the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys.
Most have read the pre-trial documents, however, and estimate Kodak will be ordered to pay $1 billion to $1.5 billion for infringing on seven Polaroid patents.
That may be the largest patent award ever, but it is well below the $12 billion Polaroid seeks. 

The highest patent damage award to date was in 1986, when Smith International Inc. was ordered to pay $205 million to Baker Hughes Inc. for infringing on a patent on an oil drilling bit seal.
The two companies later agreed to settle for $95 million. 

Few analysts think it is worth their time to slog through the Polaroid trial testimony. ""It's like panning for gold outside of Grand Central Station.
You might find something, but the chances are low,"" said Michael Ellman, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Co. 

And Eugene Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said: ""If you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a (prediction) of the eventual award, I would be willing to bet that he would be off"" by a lot. 

A 75-day trial in the early 1980s determined that Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., infringed on patents of Polaroid, of Cambridge, Mass.
The main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was ""willful and deliberate."" If so, the damages could be tripled. 

Two analysts who have read the transcripts, David Nelson of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Calvert D. Crary, a litigation analyst at Labe, Simpson & Co., think Judge A. David Mazzone will decide in Kodak's favor on the ""willful and deliberate"" issue. 

Mr. Crary said testimony by Kodak's patent counsel, Francis T. Carr of Kenyon & Kenyon, showed that ""he worked with Kodak continuously from the outset of the project"" in an effort to avoid infringement. ""Carr told Kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of Polaroid's patent positions,"" and Kodak followed his advice in every instance, Mr. Crary said. 

But Irving Kayton, a patent expert at George Mason University School of Law who is familiar with the case, said the fact that seven patents were infringed ""suggests that infringement was willful.
It's difficult to be that consistently wrong."" 

Observers also wonder whether Judge Mazzone will use the lost-profits method of determining damages, which Polaroid favors because it would result in a larger award, or the reasonable royalty method.
Polaroid claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by Kodak if Kodak hadn't entered the market.
Moreover, Polaroid contends it could have sold them at a higher price -- and thus made higher profits -- because it wouldn't have been forced to match Kodak's lower prices. 

Each side has called a Harvard Business School professor to testify on that issue.
Kodak hired Robert Buzzell and Polaroid brought in Robert J. Dolan. ""There's nothing that says that people at Harvard Business school have to agree with each other,"" said Mr. Buzzell. 

Testimony is expected to continue until early December.
A decision isn't expected until some time next year.

International Business Machines Corp. said earnings tumbled 30% in the third quarter, even a bit further than expected, rendering the outlook doubtful for the next few quarters. 

The main reason was a delay in shipment of new high-end disk drives, a business that accounts for some 10% of IBM's $60 billion of annual revenue. 

IBM, which telegraphed the poor results three weeks ago, also cited an increase in its leasing business, which tends to lock in business long-term but cut revenue in the near term.
In addition, IBM noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into dollars. 

Earnings fell to $877 million, or $1.51 a share, somewhat below securities analysts' revised expectations of around $1.60 a share.
That compared with the year-earlier $1.25 billion, or $2.10 a share -- which was inflated by a 15-cents-a-share gain from the sale of some MCI Communications Corp. stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by Fujitsu Ltd. relating to a software dispute.
Revenue climbed 4.3% to $14.31 billion from $13.71 billion. 

IBM, Armonk, N.Y., remained upbeat.
The computer giant, whose U.S. results have been dismal for years, noted that revenue rose again in the U.S. in the third quarter, following an increase in the second period.
The company said in a statement that ""demand for IBM products and services continues to be good world-wide.
We do not see anything in the fundamentals of our business that would cause us to change our strategy of investing for profitable growth."" 

Securities analysts, however, remained downbeat. ""I think 1990 will be another mediocre year,"" said Steve Milunovich of First Boston. 

Jay Stevens of Dean Witter actually cut his per-share earnings estimate to $9 from $9.50 for 1989 and to $9.50 from $10.35 in 1990 because he decided sales would be even weaker than he had expected.
Both estimates would mark declines from the 1988 net of $5.81 billion, or $9.80 a share, which itself was well below the record IBM set in 1984. 

Mr. Stevens said he kept a ""buy/hold"" recommendation on the stock only because ""all the damage has been done."" He said the stock hasn't traded below 1 1/2 times book value over the past 10 years, which at the moment computes to a stock price of $100.
The stock closed yesterday at $103 a share, up just $1 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as the market surged. 

Analysts worry that the disk-drive and leasing problems will last at least through the first quarter. 

""A key part of the question is, how soon does this disk-drive come and how soon does production ramp up?"" said Steve Cohen at SoundView Financial Group. ""And the input I've had from customers is that it still could be a while."" 

On leasing, Bob Djurdjevic at Annex Research said he thinks IBM has hurt itself unnecessarily.
He said IBM has priced its leases aggressively, thinking that would help win business.
But he said IBM would have won the business anyway as a sale to a third party that would have then leased the equipment to the customer.
He said IBM has not only hurt its short-term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases. 

Bob Bardagy, executive vice president of marketing at Comdisco Inc., a huge leasing firm, said: ""To put it mildly, IBM Credit has been doing some of the worst economic deals of any leasing company we have ever seen."" 

IBM is expected to get a boost soon when it announces some new versions of its mainframes.
But the basic technology in the line is almost five years old, which means it is long in the tooth, and competitors are rolling out strong products of their own. 

IBM is gaining momentum in the personal-computer market, and is expected to introduce some impressive workstations early next year.
But it's hard to squeeze much profit out of the personal-computer business these days, and the workstation market, while important, is too small to rely on for much growth. 

The disk drives will doubtless sell well when they finally become available.
But the AS/400, IBM's highly successful minicomputer line, is losing its momentum, and some analysts said sales could even decline in the fourth quarter.
In addition, IBM's growth in software in the third quarter was just 8.8%, well below historical levels even when adjusted to reflect last year's payment from Fujitsu and the stronger dollar.
And expenses, up 7.9% in the quarter, have stayed stubbornly high. 

In the nine months, IBM earned $3.17 billion, or $5.43 a share, down 8.4% from the year-earlier $3.46 billion, or $5.83 a share.
Revenue increased 6.5% to $42.25 billion from $39.68 billion.

PepsiCo Inc. 's chairman said he is ""more than comfortable with"" analysts' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to at least 98 cents to $1 a share from 91 cents the year earlier. 

D. Wayne Calloway, also chief executive officer of the company, indicated that he expects analysts to raise their forecasts for 1989 after the company releases its earnings today.
So far, analysts have said they are looking for $3.30 to $3.35 a share.
After today's announcement, that range could increase to $3.35 to $3.40 a share.
The official said he also would be comfortable with that new range.
In 1988, the soft-drink giant earned $2.90 a share.
Results for 1989 will include about 40 cents a share from the dilutive effects of snack-food and bottling company acquisitions. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the company closed yesterday at $57.125 a share, up $3.125. 

The company said third-quarter sales are expected to increase 25% from $3.12 billion of last year's third quarter. 

Domestic soft-drink bottler case sales are estimated to have risen only 1% in the third quarter -- well below the 4% to 5% growth of recent years -- but about in line with the rest of the soft-drink industry. 

Mr. Calloway blamed the slower volume on rainier weather, a dearth of new products in the industry and -- to a much lesser extent -- pricing.
PepsiCo said its soft-drink prices were about 2% higher in the quarter.
Mr. Calloway also noted that soft-drink volume rose a hefty 9% in last year's third quarter, making the comparison more difficult.
International soft-drink volume was up about 6%. 

Snack-food tonnage increased a strong 7% in the third quarter, while domestic profit increased in double digits, Mr. Calloway said.
Excluding the British snack-food business acquired in July, snack-food international tonnage jumped 40%, with sales strong in Spain, Mexico and Brazil.
Total snack-food profit rose 30%. 

Led by Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, restaurant earnings increased about 25% in the third quarter on a 22% sales increase.
Same-store sales for Pizza Hut rose about 13%, while Taco Bell's increased 22%, as the chain continues to benefit from its price-value strategy.
Taco Bell has turned around declining customer counts by permanently lowering the price of its tacos.
Same store-sales for Kentucky Fried Chicken, which has struggled with increased competition in the fast-food chicken market and a lack of new products, rose only 1%. 

The operation, which has been slow to respond to consumers' shifting tastes away from fried foods, has been developing a grilled-chicken product that may be introduced nationally at the end of next year.
The new product has performed well in a market test in Las Vegas, Nev., Mr. Calloway said. 

After a four-year, $7.7 billion acquisition binge that brought a major soft-drink company, soda bottlers, a fast-food chain and an overseas snack-food giant to Pepsi, Mr. Calloway said he doesn't expect any major acquisition in the next year or so.
But, ""You never can tell,"" he added, ""you have to take advantage of opportunities.""

Hydro-Quebec said it notified Central Maine Power Co. it will cancel a $4 billion contract to supply electricity to the Maine utility. 

The provincially owned utility said it is tearing up the deal because ""the contract's objectives can't be fulfilled."" Hydro-Quebec said Maine regulators' refusal to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through Maine to other utilities. ""It would now be physically impossible to begin deliveries in 1992,"" a Hydro-Quebec official said.
The contract was to run from 1992 to 2020. 

Under the contract Hydro-Quebec was to supply 400 megawatts of power to Central Maine Power starting in 1992, 600 megawatts starting in 1995 and 900 megawatts starting in 

Hydro-Quebec said Maine regulators' refusal to approve the contract means Central Maine Power has lost its place in line. ""We won't sign any new contracts {with deliveries} beginning earlier than 2000,"" the Hydro-Quebec official said.
He said Hydro-Quebec already has some ""customers in mind"" for the power that was to be delivered to Maine. ""Nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that Hydro-Quebec was the lowest-cost, most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our customers' energy needs through the year 2020,"" said Central Maine senior vice president Donald F. Kelly. 

Central Maine said it is evaluating ""many energy options"" to make up for the lost future power, including new energy generation and management proposals from New England, and possibly new Canadian purchases.

CHICAGO - Options traders were among the big victims of Friday's plunging stock market, including one small firm that required an emergency $50 million bailout. 

While Monday's rebounding markets helped other investors recoup losses, many options customers and professional traders in stock-index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with multimillion-dollar losses, traders here and in New York said. 

Options traders were hurt worse than others on Friday because of the highly volatile nature of options, which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based.
Thus, options traders Friday were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in New York. 

Jeffrey Miller of Miller Tabak Hirsch & Co. said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market, it is ""very easy for these guys to get wiped out.
That may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures."" 

An options contract gives the holder the right to buy (call) or sell (put) a specific amount of stock, or in this case the value of a stock index, based on a predetermined price within a given time period.
Options traders who, in return for a small fee, or premium, had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on Friday to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices, which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling.
They then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices -- in most cases at a substantial loss. 

The latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which has never fully recovered from the aftershock of Black Monday, when investors fled the market because of huge losses. 

Making matters worse was the fact that late Friday afternoon the CBOE halted stock-index options trading in step with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's halt in stock-index futures.
But while the Merc reopened a half hour later, the CBOE remained closed, leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses. 

CBOE Chairman Alger ""Duke"" Chapman, said that, unlike the futures market, the options exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade.
Exchange officials reasoned that they wouldn't have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining Friday afternoon, and with the stock-index futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time, the CBOE reasoned that its best course was to remain closed. 

The damage was so bad at Fossett Corp., an options trading firm here, that it was forced to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago, a unit of Continental Bank Corp., as a result of options trading losses.
Fosset so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of Friday's rout. 

Fossett still had several million dollars in capital left after Friday's close of trading, but not enough that regulators, worried about another potential market plunge yesterday, would let it reopen for trading, options exchange officials said. 

Thus, in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer, the CBOE, the American Stock Exchange and the Options Clearing Corp., as well as the firm's owner, Stephen Fossett, put up a total of $50 million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday. 

S. Waite Rawls III, vice chairman of Continental Bank, First Options' parent company, said the firm took on about 160 accounts formerly held by Fossett, almost all of them belonging to professional floor traders. 

""Steve and his firm were still worth a lot of money,"" Mr. Rawls said. ""A package of credit support was put together -- including the assets of Steve and his firm."" 

The bailout was cobbled together over the weekend, with officials from the Federal Reserve Board, Securities and Exchange Commission, Comptroller of the Currency and Treasury as well as the options exchanges. ""It was great to have the luxury of time,"" Mr. Rawls said. 

At one point, an options industry official had to talk the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's night watchman into giving him the home phone number of Silas Keene, Chicago Fed president. 

First Options didn't have to put any money into the bailout. 

Yesterday's rally in the stock, futures and options markets led CBOE and Amex officials to conclude that the $50 million in guarantees almost certainly won't need to be tapped by First Options. 

The Fossett firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the October 1987 crash as well, Mr. Rawls said. 

A federal official said that Continental Bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the Fossett bailout, but that conditions weren't dictated by those agencies. ""It was their business decision,"" the official said. 

Officials at Options Clearing Corp., which processes all options trades for U.S. exchanges, said that the $50 million guarantee was unprecedented, but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets. ""It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps,"" said Paul Stevens, OCC president and chief operating officer. 

Mr. Stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $50 million guarantee from each participant.
But CBOE and Amex officials said that Options Clearing Corp. contributed $20 million to the guarantee, the CBOE put up $8 million, the Amex added $4 million and $18 million came from Mr. Fossett's own assets. 

Mr. Fossett couldn't be reached to comment.

Debora Foster takes off her necklace, settles herself on a padded chair and gently leans forward.
With a jazz-piano tape playing softly in the background, the soothing hands of Sabina Vidunas begin to work on Ms. Foster's neck and shoulders. ""It's like an oasis in this room,"" Ms. Foster purrs.
The room in question is the directors' lounge of H.J. Heinz Co., 60 floors above the bustle of Pittsburgh.
There, amid oil paintings and marble tables, massages are administered every Wednesday. 

""On days that I'm really busy,"" says Ms. Foster, who works in public relations for the company, ""it seems decadent to take time off for a massage."" 

Although such sessions may never replace coffee breaks, on-site massage, as it is known in the trade, is certainly infiltrating corporate America.
In some companies middle managers sneak massage therapists into the office, fearful that upper-level executives won't approve. 

Ms. Foster's indulgence is nothing like the oily, hour-long rubfests enjoyed by spa visitors.
Nor does it at all resemble (despite what some executives think) the more intimate variety offered at specialty parlors in bad parts of town.
On the contrary, office rubdowns usually take place in dimly lighted conference rooms, where stressed-out employees relax in specially designed chairs, fully clothed.
The massages last 15 minutes and typically cost about $10. 

Some companies, including Heinz, even pay part of the fee.
Ms. Vidunas has been seeing some 15 clients a visit since the program was started at Heinz last year.
Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, the company's chairman, swears by her firm touch, saying regular massages are a balm for his old football injuries. 

Massage advocates say that kneading the head, shoulders, neck and back can go a long way toward easing tension and improving morale.
They also insist that touching is a basic need, as powerful as the need for food or sleep, and that the office is as good a place as any to do it. ""The blood flows to your head, you feel lightheaded and you don't feel tension around the head or neck,"" says Minnie Morey, an operations supervisor at the Social Security office in Grand Rapids, Mich., where massages began last month. ""When you leave the room after your massage, people say you look like you're glowing."" Adds Candice Ohlman, the 35-year-old masseuse who plies her trade in the Grand Rapids office, ""They fall in love with my hands."" 

Not everyone, however, is at ease with office massage.
Three years ago, the Internal Revenue Service's office in San Jose, Calif., opened its doors to on-site massage.
And even though employees paid the bill, taxpayers grumbled. 

""Sometimes, with the release of stress, you hear `oohs' and `ahs' coming out of the room,"" explains Morgan Banks, the agency's health specialist. ""And you can't have taxpayers coming into an audit hearing `oohs' and `ahs. '"" 

Last month, the complaints intensified and the massages ended. ""Now we're looking for a room with thicker walls,"" Ms. Banks says. 

Massage also has an image problem to contend with.
Some masseurs have tried to get around this by calling themselves ""bodyworkers"" and describing their office visits as ""reinvigoration breaks."" But massage, no matter how chaste, is still associated in many minds with seedy fronts for prostitution, and that makes some executives nervous. 

Last year, the research and development division of Weyerhaeuser Co., the large wood-products concern, invited a masseuse to its Tacoma, Wash., offices.
Phil Harms, a software engineer, was an eager customer. ""You build up a lot of tension working at a terminal all day,"" he says. 

But after about eight months, the vice president of the division, Ed Soule, learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt.
Mr. Soule says his only beef was that the massages were being given in a company conference room; the department's supervised health facility would have been fine. ""In my view, {massages} should be managed with an appropriate mixture of males and females around,"" he says. 

Given such attitudes, some corporate masseurs prefer to go about their business quietly.
Russell Borner of Park Ridge, N.J., says he has been working for the past year at a huge chemical and manufacturing concern in New York -- unbeknownst to the company's executives.
He visits the same department every two or three weeks.
His massage chair is kept in a closet, and a secretary escorts him past security. 

""This is common with a lot of large companies,"" says Mr. Borner, who worked for American Telephone & Telegraph Co. for 23 years before choosing his current trade.
Managers, he contends, ""are afraid how they're going to look in the eyes of their peers.
My vision is to change human consciousness towards touch.
My attitude is: Let's come out of the closet."" 

Occasionally, all that's needed is a little coaxing.
Elisa Byler, a St. Louis masseuse, won over officials at Emerson Electric Co., a maker of electrical and electronic equipment, by providing documents and other articles trumpeting the therapeutic benefits of massage.
She notes that she also stresses professionalism during her weekly visits. 

""I pull my hair back, wear a little makeup and look corporate,"" says Ms. Byler, who has been visiting Emerson since January. ""If I go in there as I normally dress, they'd ask, `Who is this hippie? '"" 

The self-proclaimed father of on-site massage is David Palmer, a 41-year-old San Francisco masseur whose mission is to save the touch-starved masses.
To help do this, Mr. Palmer developed a portable massage chair three years ago that he hopes will bring ""structured touching"" into mainstream America. 

""The culture is not ready to take off its clothes, lie down and be touched for an hour for $45,"" he says. ""The idea is to keep the clothes on and to keep people seated.
The chair is a way to package massage."" 

Sitting in one of Mr. Palmer's chairs, which cost $425 and have since been copied by others, is a bit like straddling a recliner.
Customers lean forward, rest their knees on side supports and bury their face in padding on the back of the chair. (Ms.
Ohlman, the Grand Rapids masseuse, says she has heard the odd-looking contraption compared to something out of the Spanish Inquisition.) 

Mr. Palmer, who serves as president of the On-Site Massage Association and writes an industry newsletter, says some 4,000 practitioners -- out of about 50,000 certified masseurs across the country -- now use massage chairs in the workplace, as well as on street corners, in airports and malls, and at conventions and other gatherings where weary people can be found. 

Scot MacInnis, a masseur in Boulder, Colo., had a scary experience while massaging a man in a natural-foods supermarket as part of a store promotion.
Three minutes into the massage, the man curled up, began shaking and turned red.
Paramedics were called. 

A week later, the man told Mr. MacInnis he had suffered a mild heart attack unrelated to the massage. 

""It was a powerful point in my career,"" says the 31-year-old Mr. MacInnis, who has since taken out a $1 million liability policy for his business. ""But he pulled through, and after the ambulance left, there were still six people in line waiting for a massage.
The next woman was older, and I was afraid to touch her.
But it's like falling off a horse and getting back on."" 

Despite the number of fans that office massage has won, some purists look down on it, arguing that naked, full-body rubs are the only way to go.
Linda Aldridge, who does full-body work in Pittsburgh, says that while on-site massage is better than nothing, tired workers should realize it is only the tip of the iceberg. 

""Whole areas of their bodies are neglected,"" she says, adding that clothes ruin the experience. ""There's nothing like skin to skin.""

In what is believed to be the first cancellation of a loan to China since the June 4 killings in Beijing, an international bank syndicate has terminated a $55 million credit for a Shanghai property project. 

The syndicate, led by Schroders Asia Ltd., agreed last November to provide the loan to Asia Development Corp., a U.S. property developer.
But several weeks ago, in the wake of the Beijing killings, the loan was canceled, according to bankers and executives close to the project.
Asia Development and Schroders declined to comment on the move. 

Lenders had doubts about the project even before June 4, but the harsh crackdown, which caused many businesses to reassess their China transactions, ""gave the banks the out they wanted,"" says an official close to the Shanghai venture. 

The decision to cancel the loan exemplifies the tough attitude bankers have taken toward China since June 4.
While some commercial lending has resumed, international lenders remain nervous about China's economic troubles and foreign debt -- $40 billion at the end of 1988. 

Many loans are being renegotiated, especially those tied to the hotel sector, which has been hit hard by a post-June 4 tourism slump.
Many bankers view property-sector loans as particularly risky. 

The canceled Shanghai loan leaves Asia Development, a small concern, saddled with a half-completed 32-story apartment building and heavy debts.
The company owes $11 million to the Shui On Group, the project's Hong Kong contractor, and a significant, though unspecified, amount in legal fees to Coudert Brothers, a U.S. law firm, the sources say. 

The project, known as Lotus Mansion, has been mired in controversy.
When the loan agreement was announced, it was hailed as one of the first Western-style financing transactions ever used in China.
Unlike most loans to China, there was no Chinese guarantor.
Instead, the banks secured a promise from state-owned Bank of Communications that it would lend Asia Development the entire $55 million at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing.
The loan was to have matured in just two to three years, as soon as construction was completed. 

But in a letter sent in August to Asia Development, Schroders said the loan was terminated because the developer had failed to deliver adequate financial data and pay certain fees to the loan-management committee on time, according to officials close to the project.
Creditors involved in the project contend, however, that the termination actually had nothing to do with these technical violations. 

Instead, the creditors say, the loan fell victim to nervousness about China's political turmoil, as well as to concern about the loan's security.
The bank syndicate is made up mostly of European banks, but it includes China's state-owned Citic Industrial Bank. 

The 11 banks in the syndicate sustained no monetary losses because none of the credit facility had been drawn down.

K mart Corp. agreed to acquire Pace Membership Warehouse Inc. for $23 a share, or $322 million, in a move to expand its presence in the rapidly growing warehouse-club business. 

The proposed merger comes as K mart's profit is declining and sales at its core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. K mart, based in Troy, Mich., recently said net income would fall for the third consecutive quarter, after a 16% drop in the first half of its current fiscal year. 

""The membership warehouse-club concept has great potential,"" the company's chairman, Joseph E. Antonini, said in a statement.
Warehouse clubs typically carry general merchandise and food products, which they sell for close to wholesale prices in no-frills stores.
Shoppers, many of whom operate small businesses, pay annual membership fees, which provide an income base for the stores. 

K mart tested the warehouse-club sector last year with its acquisition of a 51% interest in Makro Inc.
But the Makro chain, which operates as a joint venture between K mart and SHV Holdings N.V. of the Netherlands, has only six stores and annual sales that one analyst estimated at about $300 million. 

Six-year-old Pace, based in Aurora, Colo., operates 41 warehouse-club stores.
The company had losses for several years before turning profitable in fiscal 1988.
In the year ended Jan. 31, Pace rang up profit of $9.4 million, or 72 cents a share, after a tax-loss carry-forward, on sales of $1.3 billion, and analysts expect its results to continue to improve. 

""The company turned the corner fairly recently in profitability,"" said Margo McGlade of PaineWebber Inc., who had been forecasting a 46% jump in Pace's net income from operations this year and another 42% increase next year. ""Warehouse productivity is really beginning to take off."" 

But some analysts contend K mart has agreed to pay too much for Pace. ""Even if you look at it as a turnaround situation, it's expensive,"" said Wayne Hood of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ""In my opinion, you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry."" 

Ms. McGlade of PaineWebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal. ""If K mart can't get its act together in discounting, why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets?"" She said, ""I would say K mart's number one job is to address its market-share loss {in discount stores}, which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins.
At that point, perhaps diversification would be appropriate."" 

But K mart's Mr. Antonini is intent on pushing the company into new retail businesses.
For instance, K mart is opening big food and general merchandise stores, called hypermarkets, and warehouse-type stores specializing in office products and sporting goods.
It also operates Waldenbooks, Pay Less Drug Stores and Builders Square home improvement stores. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, K mart closed yesterday at $36 a share, up 12.5 cents.
Pace rose $2.625 to close at $22.125 a share in national over-the-counter trading. 

A K mart spokesman said the acquisition would be financed with short-term borrowings. 

Under terms of the agreement, a K mart subsidiary will soon make a tender offer for Pace shares.
Among the conditions of the offer is that Pace shareholders tender a majority of the company's shares outstanding.
The companies said Pace would ill continue to operate under its present management.

Traders nervously watching their Quotron electronic-data machines yesterday morning were stunned to see the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummet 99 points in seconds.
A minute later it soared 128 points, then zoomed back down 113 points, 69 below Friday's close. 

""It was crazy,"" said Neil Weisman, general partner of Chilmark Capital Corp. ""It was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane."" 

But those who said ""This can't be happening"" were right.
The Quotrons were wrong. 

Quotron Systems Inc., a Citicorp unit, blamed the 30-minute foul-up on ""a timing problem in our software"" caused by the enormous early volume -- about 145 million shares in the first hour of New York Stock Exchange trading.
The prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct, Quotron said, but the average was wrong. 

Meanwhile, there was an awful lot of confusion.
At about 10:40 a.m. on the over-the-counter trading desk at a major brokerage firm, a veteran trader who buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior official and asked, ""What's going on?
Is the market up or down?"" 

At the time, Quotron was reporting that the industrial average was down 70 points.
In fact, it was up 24. 

Holly Stark, a vice president who heads the trading desk at Dillon Read Capital Corp., said that once she figured out the Quotron numbers were wrong, she called brokers to tell them. ""It's been kind of annoying, to say the least,"" she said.
To confuse matters further, when UAL Corp. stock finally opened on the New York Stock Exchange at 11:08 a.m., the price was listed at $324.75 a share, up about $45 from Friday; in fact, its true price was $224.75, down $55. 

That was the New York Stock Exchange's blooper.
A spokesman cited a ""technical error"" and declined to elaborate. 

And there were other blunders.
When the market opened at 9:30 a.m. EST, a reporter for the Reuters newswire miscalculated the industrial average's drop as a 4% decline when it really was down 0.7%. ""It was a case of human error, which we found almost immediately and corrected,"" a spokesman for Reuter in New York said. 

Meanwhile, some currency traders at West German banks in Frankfurt said they sold dollars on the news and had to buy them back later at higher prices. 

But it was the Quotron problems that had lingering effects.
Dillon Read's Ms. Stark said in early afternoon that she was still viewing prices and other data as subject to verification, and she said portfolio managers continued to question the numbers they saw on the screen. 

It was the second time in less than a week that Quotron has had problems calculating the industrial average.
At the start of trading last Wednesday, the average appeared to plunge more than 200 points.
Actually, it was down only a few points at the time. 

Quotron said that snafu, which lasted nine minutes, resulted from a failure to adjust for a 4-for-1 stock split at Philip Morris Cos. 

A Quotron spokeswoman said recent software changes may have contributed to yesterday's problems.
She said Quotron switched to a backup system until the problems were corrected. 

""Today of all days,"" she lamented. ""The eyes of the world were watching us.""

Houston attorney Dale Friend, representing a plaintiff in a damage suit, says he has negotiated a settlement that will strike a blow for his client.
Literally. 

It turns out Mr. Friend's client, Machelle Parks of Cincinnati, didn't like the way defense attorney Tom Alexander acted during the legal proceedings.
So she has agreed to forgo monetary damages against Mr. Alexander's client in return for the right to punch the attorney.
Ms. Parks's mother also gets to cuff Mr. Alexander.
So does Mr. Friend and his law partner, Nick Nichols. 

The bizarre arrangement grows out of Mr. Alexander's representation of Derr Construction Co., one of several defendants in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by Ms. Parks, the widow of a construction worker killed in January 1987 while working on a new Houston convention center.
Last month, Mr. Friend says, Mr. Alexander's associate agreed that Derr would pay $50,000 as part of an overall settlement. 

But Mr. Alexander scuttled the deal at the last minute, angering the plaintiff's side. ""I never agreed to it,"" Mr. Alexander says, adding that ""it's not necessary to pay these nuisance settlements."" 

When Ms. Parks and her mother heard about what had happened, Mr. Friend says, they volunteered that they would like to give Mr. Alexander a good walloping.
Mr. Friend says he passed that along to his adversary, and soon they were talking about the ground rules under which Derr could keep its money and the plaintiffs could take a shot at Mr. Alexander. 

Although time and place have yet to be determined, some details are in place.
Mr. Friend says he agreed to strike Mr. Alexander above the belt.
Ms. Parks and her mother indicated they want to ""catch him unawares from behind,"" he says.
Mr. Alexander, for his part, insisted that the punchers can't assign their pummeling rights to anyone else, can't use a blunt instrument and can't take a running start. 

Mr. Alexander says he regards the agreement, which hasn't been submitted to a judge, as something of a joke.
However, he acknowledges they ""have the option of taking a swat at me if they really want to."" Mr. Friend says his side is ""dead serious."" Although they don't contemplate delivering any disabling blows, he says that Mr. Alexander will be asked to sign a release from liability, just in case.

After two years of drought, it rained money in the stock-index futures markets yesterday. 

As financial markets rebounded, trading volume in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's huge Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index futures pit soared, reaching near-record levels for the first time since October 1987. 

The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared, traders said. 

""Guys were minting money in there today,"" said John Legittino, a futures broker for Elders Futures Inc. in Chicago. 

The S&P 500 futures contract, which moves in fractions of an index point under normal conditions, jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn, then moved strongly higher the rest of the day.
Each index point represents a $500 profit for each S&P 500 contract held.
For the first time since the 1987 crash, traders said that they were able to trade several hundred S&P 500 contracts at a time in a highly liquid market. 

Many institutions and individual investors have shied away from stock-index futures, blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on Black Monday two years ago.
Since the crash, many futures traders haven't assumed large positions for fear that the S&P 500 market, with much of its customer order flow missing, would dry up if prices turned against them. 

More than 400 traders jammed the S&P 500 futures pit to await the opening bell.
Traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at 8:30 am 

The contract fell five points at the open to 323.85, the maximum opening move allowed under safeguards adopted by the Merc to stem a market slide.
But several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts, driving prices sharply higher.
The market hovered near Friday's closing price of 328.85 for about a half hour, moving several index points higher or lower in seconds, then broke higher and didn't look back. 

The S&P 500 contract that expires in December closed up a record 15.65 points on volume of nearly 80,000 contracts. 

""Traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart,"" said one S&P 500 broker. ""You could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune,"" he marveled. 

Several of Wall Street's largest securities firms, including Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Inc., were also large buyers, traders said.
Salomon Brothers was among the largest sellers of stock-index futures last week, traders said.
Brokerage firms as a rule don't comment on their market activity. 

Unlike the week following Black Monday two years ago, individual traders in the S&P 500 pit were also being uncharacteristically circumspect about their one-day profits. 

""With the FBI around here, bragging rights are a thing of the past,"" said one trader, referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far has resulted in 46 indictments lodged against individuals on the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade.

The market for $200 billion of high-yield junk bonds regained some of its footing as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded from Friday's plunge. 

But the junk recovery, led by the bellwether RJR Holdings bonds, was precarious.
No trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds, securities industry officials said.
On Friday, trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential buyers fled and brokerage firms were unwilling to provide bid and offer prices for most issues. 

""Nothing traded on Friday, and people weren't really sure where the market should have opened"" yesterday, said Raymond Minella, co-head of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co. ""But we had a fairly active day yesterday."" 

At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the leading underwriter of junk bonds, ""I was prepared to be in a very bad mood tonight,"" said David Feinman, a junk bond trader. ""Now, I feel maybe there's a little bit of euphoria."" But before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell-off yesterday, he said, ""You couldn't buy {junk bonds} and you couldn't give them away."" 

Yesterday's rally was led by RJR Holdings 13 3/4% bonds, which initially tumbled three points, or $30 for each $1,000 face amount, to 96 1/4 before rebounding to 99 3/4.
Bonds issued by Kroger, Duracell, Safeway and American Standard also showed big gains, recovering almost all their losses from Friday and early yesterday. 

But traders said the junk bond market increasingly is separating into a top-tier group, in which trades can be executed easily, and a larger group of lower-quality bonds in which liquidity -- or the ability to trade without too much difficulty -- has steadily deteriorated this year. 

""Liquidity hasn't returned to the vast middle ground of the market,"" said Mr. Minella of Merrill. 

""The deadbeats are still deadbeats,"" said Mr. Feinman of Drexel. 

Analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain treacherous for investors.
Paul Asquith, associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later, says, ""We're now in a period where we're starting to see defaults from the big issue years of 1984 to 1986."" 

Mark Bachmann, a senior vice president at Standard & Poor's Corp., confirms that there is ""increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market."" 

""Junk bonds are a highly stratified market,"" said Lewis Glucksman, vice chairman of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ""There's a whole bunch of stuff that's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that's not so good."" 

Analysts at Standard & Poor's say junk bond offerings by ""tightly stretched"" issuers seem to be growing.
Almost $8 billion of junk bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from SCI TV, Gillette Holdings (not related to Gillette Co.), Interco, Seaman Furniture, Allied Stores, Federated Department Stores, National Gypsum, M.D.C. Holdings, Micropolis, Leaseway Transportation and Price Communications. 

""You could still have some very bad times ahead,"" said Mr. Bachmann. ""It's possible to have a 10% default rate in one year, because we're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy.
I'm certainly not comfortable saying we've seen the bottom."" 

But yesterday's rally among ""good"" junk was a badly needed tonic for the market.
Many issues ""bounced off the floor,"" Mr. Minella said, and benchmark junk issues ""recovered all of their losses"" from Friday and early yesterday.
In contrast, he says, ""The stock market gained back only about half what it lost Friday, and the {government} bond market lost about half what it gained Friday."" 

Traders said yesterday's rally was fueled by insurance companies looking for bargains after a drastic slide in prices the past month.
In addition, mutual funds didn't appear to be major sellers of high-yield securities as was expected. 

""Sometimes a shakeout is healthy,"" said Drexel's Mr. Feinman. ""People will learn to be more circumspect.
If they do good credit analysis, they will avoid the hand grenades.
I think the market is in good shape.""

Donald Trump, who faced rising doubt about his bid for American Airlines parent AMR Corp. even before a United Airlines buy-out came apart Friday, withdrew his $7.54 billion offer. 

Separately, bankers representing the group trying to buy United's parent UAL Corp. met with other banks about reviving that purchase at a lower price, possibly around $250 a share, or $5.65 billion.
But a lower bid could face rejection by the UAL board. 

Mr. Trump, who vowed Wednesday to ""go forward"" with the bid, said he was dropping it ""in light of the recent change in market conditions."" He said he might now sell his AMR stake, buy more shares, or make another offer at a lower price. 

The Manhattan real-estate developer acted after the UAL buyers failed to obtain financing for their earlier $300-a-share bid, which sparked a selling panic among that snowballed into a 190-point drop Friday in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 

News about UAL and AMR, whose shares never reopened after trading was halted Friday for the UAL announcement, sent both stocks nosediving in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

UAL tumbled $56.875 to $222.875 on volume of 2.3 million shares, and AMR declined by $22.125 to $76.50 as 4.7 million shares changed hands.
Together, the two stocks wreaked havoc among takeover stock traders, and caused a 7.3% drop in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, second in size only to the stock-market crash of Oct. 19, 1987. 

Some said Friday's market debacle had given Mr. Trump an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the UAL deal.
After reaching an intraday high of $107.50 the day Mr. Trump disclosed his bid Oct. 5, AMR's stock had retreated as low as $97.75 last week. 

Some takeover stock traders had been betting against Mr. Trump because he has a record of disclosing stakes in companies that are potential takeover targets, then selling at a profit without making a bid. 

""He still hasn't proven his mettle as a big-league take-out artist,"" said airline analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley & Co. ""He's done this thing where he'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it.
He's written this book, `The Art of the Deal. ' Why doesn't he just follow through on one of these things?"" 

Mr. Trump withdrew his bid before the AMR board, which is due to meet tomorrow, ever formally considered it.
AMR had weighed a wide range of possible responses, from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees, a friendlier buyer such as Texas billionaire Robert Bass, or both. 

AMR had also sought to foil Mr. Trump in Congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the Transportation Department to reject airline buy-outs.
Yesterday, Mr. Trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the UAL deal on Congress, saying it was rushing through a bill to protect AMR executives. 

""I believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the UAL transaction, and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past Friday,"" Mr. Trump wrote members of Congress. 

AMR declined to comment, and Mr. Trump didn't respond to requests for interviews. 

Mr. Trump never said how much AMR stock he had bought, only that his holdings were ""substantial."" However, he only received federal clearance to buy more than $15 million of the stock on Sept. 20, when the price rose $2 a share to $78.50.
Between then and his bid on Oct. 5, the price fluctuated between $75.625 and $87.375. 

In an attempt to persuade investors that his bid wasn't just ""a stock play,"" Mr. Trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares.
AMR was trading at around $84 yesterday before his withdrawal announcement, then immediately fell to about $76. 

Assuming that he paid a rough average price of $80 a share, and assuming he didn't sell before his announcement reached the market, Mr. Trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $76.50. 

Some analysts said AMR Chairman Robert Crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation's largest airline with a defensive transaction, such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees.
However, other knowledgeable observers said they believed Mr. Crandall and the AMR board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps. 

Some analysts said they believed Mr. Trump, whose towering ego had been viewed by some as a reason to believe he wouldn't back out, might come back with a lower bid.
Ray Neidl of Dillon Read & Co. said Mr. Trump ""is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle.
I'm sure he still wants AMR."" 

But others remained skeptical. ""I was never sure Donald Trump really wanted to take AMR,"" said John Mattis, a bond analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ""What happened with United was a gracious way for him to bow out."" Mr. Trump never obtained financing for his bid. 

That skepticism would leave him with an even greater credibility problem should he return that would handicap him in any effort to oust the board in a proxy fight. 

Meanwhile, Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp., the two lead lenders on the UAL buy-out, met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price.
Officials familiar with the talks said Citicorp had discussed lowering the offer to $250 a share, but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made. 

At $250 a share, the group would have to borrow about $6.1 billion from banks.
The first UAL deal unraveled after Citibank and Chase couldn't raise $7.2 billion.
Citibank and Chase had agreed to commit $3 billion, and said they were ""highly confident"" of raising another $4.2 billion. 

Together, Citicorp and Chase received $8 million in fees to raise the rest of the financing.
But other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the UAL group was willing to pay them.
Officials familiar with the bank talks said the UAL buy-out group -- UAL pilots, management, and British Airways PLC -- is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest, but isn't likely to boost its $965 million equity contribution. 

Nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next 48 hours despite the hopes of many traders.
The group's advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around. 

Even if the buy-out group is able to obtain financing, the transaction still faces obstacles. 

UAL's board could reject the new price as too low, especially since there aren't any competing bids.
Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis, whose $275-a-share offer was rejected by UAL's board, hasn't shown signs of pursuing a $300-a-share back-up bid he made last month. 

In addition, the coalition of labor and management, longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of Mr. Davis's bid, could break apart now.
The group's resilience gets its first test today when 30 top pilot union leaders convene outside Chicago in a previously scheduled meeting.
Union Chairman F.C. (Rick) Dubinsky faces the tough task of explaining why banks refused to finance a buy-out the members approved overwhelmingly last week. 

The pilot union is vowing to pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides.
But if the board rejects a reduced bid and decides to explore other alternatives, it could transform what has been a harmonious process into an adversarial one. 

The pilots could play hardball by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes.
If they were to insist on a low bid of, say $200 a share, the board mightn't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots oppose. 

Also, because UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL executives have joined the pilots' bid, the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders.
That could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder.

The bill, whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that wouldn't be counted on the federal budget.
The bill intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only, unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization. 

""Such agency `self-help' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive, far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing,"" said Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.), the bill's chief sponsor. 

The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC.
This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit.
Another $20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds, which pay lower interest rates. 

But the RTC also requires ""working"" capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold, until the assets can be sold separately.
That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold, leaving the total spending for the bailout at $50 billion, or $166 billion including interest over 10 years. 

""It's a problem that clearly has to be resolved,"" said David Cooke, executive director of the RTC.
The agency has already spent roughly $19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls, and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes. 

Absent other working capital, he said, the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets. ""We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward,"" he said. 

The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight.
The law does allow the RTC to borrow from the Treasury up to $5 billion at any time.
Moreover, it says the RTC's total obligations may not exceed $50 billion, but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt, and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds. 

But Congress didn't anticipate or intend more public debt, say opponents of the RTC's working-capital plan, and Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) said the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in not keeping Congress informed. 

""That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means, which seems to me sort of draconian,"" he said. ""The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility."" 

The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday.

We're about to see if advertising works. 

Hard on the heels of Friday's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that's followed, a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message: Keep on investing, the market's just fine.
Their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market, as individual investors did in droves after the crash in October 

Just days after the 1987 crash, major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors.
This time around, they're moving even faster. 

PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night.
Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday, and wrote another new ad appearing today.
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads.
It considered running them during tomorrow night's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday.
Other brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch & Co., were plotting out potential new ad strategies. 

The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around, when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic.
This time, the firms were ready.
Fidelity, for example, prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge.
When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon, the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers.
The ads touted Fidelity's automated 800-number beneath the huge headline, ""Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call."" 

A Fidelity spokesman says the 800-line, which already was operating but which many clients didn't know about, received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend. ""A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us,"" he says. ""To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial.
It would have been too late to think about on Friday.
We had to think about it ahead of time."" 

Today's Fidelity ad goes a step further, encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity.
Underneath the headline ""Diversification,"" it counsels, ""Based on the events of the past week, all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market's volatility."" It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name. 

PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash.
In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle, the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house, ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night.
It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which CNN would agree to air its last-minute creations. 

The new PaineWebber commercial, created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co., features Mary Farrell, one of the firm's most visible investment strategists, sounding particularly bullish.
Taped just as the market closed yesterday, it offers Ms. Farrell advising, ""We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle. . . . We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation."" The spot was scheduled to appear three times on CNN last night. 

PaineWebber considered an even harder sell, recommending specific stocks.
Instead, it settled on just urging the clients who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market. 

""We're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything, which just drives the prices down further,"" says John Lampe, PaineWebber's director of advertising. ""If you owned it and liked it Friday, the true value hasn't changed."" He adds, ""This isn't 1987 revisited."" 

With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday, investment firms had to constantly revise their approach.
At Shearson Lehman, executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend, then had to regroup yesterday afternoon.
The plan had been to make one of Shearson's easy-to-film, black-and-white ""Where We Stand"" commercials, which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985.
The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow, replacing the debut commercial of Shearson's new ad campaign, ""Leadership by Example."" 

But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday, Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad. ""We don't think at this point anything needs to be said.
The market seems to be straightening out; we're taking a wait-and-see attitude,"" says Cathleen B. Stewart, executive vice president of marketing. 

In any case, the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987.
But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective.
In 1987, despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms, individuals ran from the market en masse.
Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around.

You know what the law of averages is, don't you?
It's what 1) explains why we are like, well, ourselves rather than Bo Jackson; 2) cautions that it's possible to drown in a lake that averages two feet deep; and 3) predicts that 10,000 monkeys placed before 10,000 pianos would produce 1,118 publishable rock 'n' roll tunes. 

Baseball, that game of the long haul, is the quintessential sport of the mean, and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend.
The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team Oakland A's, the gang that had been done unto similarly by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Orel Hershiser in last year's tournament.
Morever, much of the damage was accomplished by A's who had some catching up to do. 

In game two, on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn, a lot of the catching up was done by the A's catcher, Terry Steinbach.
He hit a 2-0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1, where it stayed.
So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games, and batted in the seventh position of the A's lineup. ""If you get your pitch, and take a good swing, anything can happen,"" he later remarked. 

On Saturday night, quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and, no doubt, future droughts.
Mark McGwire, the big, red-haired Oakland first baseman, had three hits in four at bats, two more than he'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he'd gone 1-for-17.
The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9, a.k.a. the ""bottom of the order,"" got seven of their team's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision. 

Right-hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger.
That he was the A's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21-9 mark, plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs, indicates he may have some evening up coming, but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving, that might not be this week.
The same goes for Mike Moore, another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday's contest. 

""Every guy they put out there had a better split-finger than the guy before,"" marveled Giant manager Roger Craig.
He's an ex-hurler who's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery, which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat. 

The upshot of the downshoot is that the A's go into San Francisco's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best-of-seven fest.
The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs (29 of 39) that took 2-0 Series leads went on to win it all.
That's not an average to soothe Giant rooters. 

One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called BART (that's a better name for a public conveyance than ""Desire,"" don't you think?) would have been ecstatic over the proceedings, but they observe them in relative calm.
Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum, and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition, hostilities advanced no further, at least as far as I could see. 

A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams. ""I'm for the Giants today, but only because they lost yesterday.
I love 'em both.
The only thing I'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games,"" said David Williams, a Sacramento septuagenarian, at the Coliseum before Sunday's go. 

The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility.
I choose to believe it's the latter, although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here, including the A's and Giants, is originally from somewhere else.
Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees-Mets series, or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox (hey, it's possible), you'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans, and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets. 

Anyway, the A's gave you a lot of heroes to root for.
In the opening game, besides Steinbach and Stewart, there was Walt Weiss, a twiggy-looking, second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery.
He was flawless afield (ditto in game two), moved a runner along in the A's three-run second inning, and homered for his team's final tally.
Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season, the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph.
Not his autograph; power-hitter McGwire's. 

An A's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson, who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation.
He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits, seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats, and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday, along with walking, stealing a base and scoring a run. ""When you're in the groove, you see every ball tremendously,"" he lectured. 

The cold guys in the set were Will Clark, Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams, the Giants' 3-4-5 hitters.
They combined for 25 hits, six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs.
They went a collective 5-for-24 here, with zero homers and ribbies. 

It's that last set of numbers, as much as anything else, that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come. ""I believe in the law of averages,"" declared San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two. ""I'd rather see a so-so hitter who's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who's cold."" 

But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side. ""When it goes, you never know when you'll get it back,"" he said. ""That's baseball.""

NCR Corp. reported a 10% drop in third-quarter net income, citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip. 

Net income for the quarter fell to $93.1 million from $103.1 million, roughly what analysts had expected.
But per-share profit dropped only 2% to $1.23 a share from $1.26 a share, as the company continued its stock buy-back plan.
Average shares outstanding dropped to 75.8 million from 82.1 million.
Revenue fell 1% to $1.39 billion from $1.41 billion. 

The computer maker, which sells more than half its goods outside the U.S., also said the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will ""adversely affect"" its fourth-quarter performance and ""make it difficult"" to better 1988 results. 

NCR said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas, reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets.
The company, however, said orders in the U.S. showed ""good gains"" during the latest quarter.
Analysts estimate those gains at 12% to 13%, a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of NCR's major customers. 

In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry, NCR, which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers, is also affected by the retail and financial sectors, ""areas of the economy that have generally not been robust,"" notes Sanjiv G. Hingorani, an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. 

These factors, combined with a strong dollar, should negatively affect the current quarter's results, NCR said.
In the year-earlier fourth quarter, NCR had profit of $149.6 million, or $1.85 a share, on revenue of $1.8 billion. 

Mr. Hingorani said he lowered his full-year estimates for 1989 to $5.35 a share from $5.50 a share.
Revenue projections were slashed to $6.03 billion from $6.20 billion.
Last year, NCR had net income of $439.3 million, or $5.33 a share, on $5.99 billion in revenue. 

For the nine months, the company's earnings fell 9% to $264.6 million, or $3.40 a share, from $289.7 million, or $3.49 a share.
Revenues declined 1% to $4.17 billion from $4.19 billion. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, NCR shares fell 75 cents to close at $57.

Concerning your Sept. 19 article ""Wall Street Firms Link Analysts' Pay to Performance,"" I'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard, cold facts of the real working world.
If the firms are serious, however, why limit the practice to the poor, maligned analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best?
Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force, and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year?
That should stop a lot of account-churning, and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern, careful thought and good sense.
Now, wouldn't that be a novelty.

Steve Clark, a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. trader, reported for work at 5 a.m., two and a half hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting. 

At Jefferies & Co., J. Francis Palamara didn't reach the office until 5:30 a.m., but then he had been up most of the night at home. ""I had calls all night long from the States,"" he said. ""I was woken up every hour -- 1:30, 2:30, 3:30, 4:30.
People are looking for possible opportunities to buy, but nobody wants to stick their chin out."" 

For many of London's securities traders, it was a day that started nervously in the small hours.
By lunchtime, the selling was at near-panic fever.
But as the day ended in a frantic Wall Street-inspired rally, the City breathed a sigh of relief. 

So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London's financial district.
In the wake of Wall Street's plunge last Friday, the London market was considered especially vulnerable.
And before the opening of trading here yesterday, all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be. 

By the time trading officially got under way at 9 a.m., the news from Asia was in.
And it left mixed signals for London.
Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but less-than-alarming 1.8% on thin volume; Hong Kong stocks declined 6.5% in orderly trading. 

At Jefferies' trading room on Finsbury Circus, a stately circle at the edge of the financial district, desktop computer screens displayed the London market's major barometer -- the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index.
Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks; blue figures, rising stocks.
Right away, the reds outnumbered the blues, 80 to 20, as the index opened at 2076.8, off 157.1 points, or 7%. 

""I see concern, but I don't see any panic,"" said Mr. Palamara, a big, good-humored New York native who runs the 15-trader office. 

The Jefferies office, a branch of the Los Angeles-based firm, played it conservatively, seeking to avoid risk. ""This is not the sort of market to have a big position in,"" said David Smith, who heads trading in all non-U.S. stocks. ""We tend to run a very tight book."" Jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers, and there weren't many buyers. 

""All the takeover stocks -- Scottish & Newcastle, B.A.T, DRG -- are getting pretty well pasted this morning,"" Mr. Smith said.
Seconds later, a 7,500-share ""sell"" order for Scottish & Newcastle came in.
For the third time in 15 minutes, a trader next to Mr. Smith left the no-smoking area to have a cigarette.
On the screens, only two forlorn blue figures remained, but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140. 

""Because Tokyo didn't collapse, let's pick up a little stock,"" Mr. Smith said.
He targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers' price quotes.
The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at 845 pence, ($13.27) and Mr. Smith's traders started putting out feelers.
But the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling, and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence. 

""When I want to buy, they run from you -- they keep changing their prices,"" Mr. Smith said. ""It's very frustrating."" He temporarily abandoned his search for the Reuters shares. 

By this time, it was 4:30 a.m. in New York, and Mr. Smith fielded a call from a New York customer wanting an opinion on the British stock market, which had been having troubles of its own even before Friday's New York market break. 

""Fundamentally dangerous. . . ,"" Mr. Smith said, almost in a whisper, "". . . .fundamentally weak . . . fairly vulnerable still . . . extremely dangerously poised . . . we're in for a lot of turbulence. . . ."" 

He was right.
By midday, the London market was in full retreat. ""It's falling like a stone,"" said Danny Linger, a pit trader who was standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange.
Only half the usual lunchtime crowd gathered at the tony Corney & Barrow wine bar on Old Broad Street nearby.
Conversation was subdued as most patrons watched the latest market statistics on television.
At 12:49 p.m., the index hit its low, 2029.7, off 204.2 points. 

""France opened the limit down, off at least 10% if you could calculate the index, which you couldn't,"" Mr. Clark, the Shearson trader, said early in the afternoon. ""Spain is down 10% and suspended, Sweden's down 8%, Norway 11%.
This market has been very badly damaged."" 

As 2:30 p.m. -- Wall Street's opening time -- neared, Shearson traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the New York market would open. 

In the center of the trading floor, chief trader Roger Streeter and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- plummeting more than 60 points in the first few minutes.
They saw an opportunity created by the sell-off.
As Wall Street traders dumped American Depositary Receipts in Jaguar PLC, Mr. Streeter and trader Sam Ruiz bought them to resell in the U.K. Investors here still expect Ford Motor Co. or General Motors Corp. to bid for Jaguar. 

Suddenly, after about 45 minutes, the U.S. markets rallied. ""The MMI has gone better,"" shouted one trader at about 3:15 London time, as the U.S. Major Markets Index contract suddenly indicated a turnabout. 

As Wall Street strengthened, the London trading room went wild.
Traders shouted as their screens posted an ever-narrowing loss on Wall Street.
Then, nine minutes later, Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day. ""Rally! Rally! Rally!"" shouted Shearson trader Andy Rosen, selling more Jaguar shares. ""This is panic buying!"" 

As the London market rallied, some wondered whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it.
The London index closed at 2163.4, its high for the day, off 70.5, or about 3.3%.

The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major U.S. airlines. 

The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, spurred quick action on the legislation, introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday.
The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow, and a floor vote by next week will be urged. 

The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump, who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines.
In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar (D., Minn.), Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for AMR, and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal. 

Elaine Chao, deputy transportation secretary, also sent a letter to express the administration's opposition to the bill ""in its present form."" 

Rep. Oberstar brushed off Mr. Trump's allegations as an ""excuse for his own deal failing."" He also said the fact that the other letter hadn't come from Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner indicated there is ""wiggle room"" in the administration's position. 

Mr. Oberstar and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation wasn't a response to any particular market situation.
But they cited the UAL and AMR examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation. 

Aides both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR isn't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation. ""It's still on the fast track and we still want to do it,"" said one Senate aide. 

The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out. 

Currently, the transportation secretary doesn't have clearly established authority to block mergers, but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit.
Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process, and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry. 

In general, the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15% or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired.
It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition. 

The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information hasn't been provided, or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially, result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets, or give control to a foreign interest.
If more information is needed, the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days. 

All the witnesses, both congressmen and industry experts, expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe, cost-effective service.
But several committee members disapproved, some backing Mr. Trump's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge. 

One of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin-off companies.

In a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between Boeing Co. and striking Machinists union members, a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow. 

""It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one,"" said Doug Hammond, the mediator, who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations. ""We're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that, we have made no expression of expectations,"" a Boeing spokesman said. 

The Machinists union has rejected a three-year contract offer that would have provided a 10% wage increase over the life of the pact, plus some bonuses.
Currently, average pay for machinists is $13.39 an hour, Boeing said. 

Now in its 13th day, the strike has idled about 55,000 machinists and has started to delay delivery of some jetliners. 

With a strike fund of about $100 million, the union had said it was prepared for a long strike.
After the third week on strike, union members will begin receiving $100 a week from the fund. 

Work at Boeing continues with supervisors and other non-striking personnel manning the lines.
And at the company's Wichita, Kan., plant, about 2,400 of the 11,700 machinists still are working, Boeing said.
Under Kansas right-to-work laws, contracts cannot require workers to be union members.
Boeing has declined to say how many employees are working at its giant Renton, Wash., plant. 

Union officials couldn't be reached for comment.

DPC Acquisition Partners, a hostile suitor for Dataproducts Corp., said it intends to launch a tender offer for the computer printer maker's common stock. 

DPC, a group led by the New York investment firm Crescott Inc., also said it plans to file preliminary materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust Dataproducts' board. 

DPC holds a 7.8% stake in Dataproducts and made a $15-a-share bid for the company in May, but Dataproducts management considered the $283.7 million proposal unacceptable.
A DPC spokesman declined to elaborate on the group's new plan. 

In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Dataproducts shares jumped 62.5 cents to close at $9.375. 

Dataproducts, which had been seeking a buyer for several months, announced a restructuring plan in September and took itself off the auction block.
The company's restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors, to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its New England subsidiary.
As part of the plan, Dataproducts announced a pact to sell $63 million of its real estate holdings to Trizec Properties Inc., a unit of Canada's Trizec Corp. 

Jack Davis, Dataproducts' president, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company ""is at a loss to understand DPC's intentions."" He called today's announcement ""opportunistic and disruptive"" and said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring.

Share prices plummeted across Europe yesterday in response to Friday's New York sell-off, but some issues staged a late comeback after Wall Street opened without another rout. 

European investors have further reason for optimism today, after the U.S. rebound. 

The Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which closed before the New York exchanges opened, was the hardest hit of the major European markets, with the DAX Index dropping 12.8%. 

In London, prices plummeted in early trading and were off as much as 9% before coming back strong after the New York opening to close down only 3.2%. 

West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said, ""In my view, the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly.
There may be one or other psychological or technical reactions, but they aren't based on fundamentals.
The economy of West Germany and the EC {European Community} is highly stable."" 

Paris, which has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks, also was hard hit.
Share prices fell in Milan, Amsterdam, Zurich, Madrid and Stockholm.
Prices in Brussels, where a computer breakdown disrupted trading, also tumbled.
Following is a breakdown of major market activity: 

FRANKFURT: One of the sharpest declines came in the financial center of Europe's strongest economy.
The DAX Index of 30 West German blue chips plunged 12.8%, a one-day record, wiping out the summer's gains.
The index closed at 1385.72, down 203.56 points. 

By comparison, two years ago on Black Monday, the new index would have dropped 9.4%, according to a projection by the exchange.
Investors may have reacted so strongly to Friday's U.S. stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the Frankfurt exchange's losing 35% of its value in the 1987 crash and its wake. 

This time, however, many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly. ""They all went in the wrong direction,"" said Andreas Insam, an investment adviser for the Bank in Liechtenstein's Frankfurt branch.
He said he told clients to buy selected West German blue chips after they fell by about 10%. 

After the opening was delayed 30 minutes because of the crush of sell orders, Frankfurt's normal two-hour trading session was extended 75 minutes to handle the heavy volume. ""The beginning was chaotic,"" said Nigel Longley, a broker for Commerzbank AG. ""It took three-quarters of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market."" 

Institutional investors and bankers, many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching Far Eastern markets, were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8% decline in Tokyo stock prices. ""Everybody was still confident, including most institutional investors.
That is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors,"" said Norbert Braeuer, a senior trader for Hessische Landesbank. 

Some big institutions, including banks, began picking up lower-priced shares late yesterday, but most investors wanted to see what would happen in New York before acting. 

But even if Wall Street continues to stabilize, analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the Frankfurt exchange, which already was showing signs of weakness after the DAX had slipped from a 1989 high of 1657.61 on Sept. 8. 

Some of West Germany's bluest chips took some of the biggest hits.
A 16.3% drop for Mannesmann AG and Dresdner Bank AG's 9.6% decline were especially problematic for their respective boards, whose plans for major rights issues in November could now be in jeopardy. 

Dresdner Bank last month said it hoped to raise 1.2 billion marks ($642.2 million) by issuing four million shares at 300 marks each.
Yet yesterday's market cropped Dresdner's share price by 33 marks to 309 marks a share, leaving little incentive for investors to subscribe to the standing price unless the market recovers quickly. 

LONDON: Headed toward a record drop at midday, the London stock market recouped two-thirds of its losses in the wake of New York's early rally. 

The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index closed off 70.5 points, at 2163.4, its high for the day, after having plunged 204.2 points at 12:49 p.m. 

It was big institutions such as Norwich Union Insurance Group, Scottish Amicable Investment Managers and Standard Life Assurance Co. that spearheaded the rally.
Attracted by low prices and encouraged by New York's performance, they scooped up equities across the board. 

Volume was 959.3 million shares, more than triple recent levels. 

PARIS: Late buying gave the Paris Bourse a parachute after its free fall early in the day.
The CAC General Index ended down 5.4% at 523.6, a drop of 29.6 points from Friday. 

""There was a volatility in the market that I have never seen before,"" said Michel Vigier, a partner in brokerage firm Cholet Dupont. ""When Wall Street turned around shortly after the opening, there was panic buying in Paris."" 

Brokers said that as the news spread that Wall Street was moving up, traders who had called to place sell orders changed their line in mid-conversation, ordering buys instead. 

Trading was driven primarily by small investors and speculators, with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day.
When Wall Street turned, however, the big boys entered the market, looking for bargains.

J.P. Morgan & Co. swung to a loss in the third quarter, while NCNB Corp. reported net income more than doubled, and Security Pacific Corp. net rose 10%. 

J.P. Morgan & Co. 

J.P. Morgan, as expected, posted a $1.82 billion net loss for the quarter, reflecting the New York bank's decision last month to add $2 billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries. 

The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves. 

The latest quarter's loss equals $9.92 a share.
In the year-earlier quarter, Morgan earned $233.6 million, or $1.25 a share. 

George M. Salem, analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., called the results ""mildly disappointing."" Excluding the $2 billion provision and allowing for the taxes Morgan paid, earnings were about 65 cents a share, Mr. Salem said. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Morgan climbed $1.50 a share to $44.125. 

Net interest income sank 27% in the quarter to $254 million from $347 million.
The interest rate on short-term funds, which banks borrow to finance longer-term loans to customers, was ""sharply higher,"" Morgan said. 

Morgan received $2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans; had they been accruing interest, net interest income would have been $35 million higher in the quarter, Morgan said.
Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as non-accruing, costing the bank $10 million of interest income in the third period. 

Income from sources other than interest climbed 12% to $414 million, reflecting higher corporate-finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities. ""These increases were partly offset by lower trading-related"" income, the bank said.
Non-interest expenses grew 16% to $496 million. 

NCNB Corp. 

NCNB Corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period, largely because of continued strong performance by the bank's Texas operations. 

The Charlotte, N.C., company said earnings rose to $143.6 million, or $1.45 a share, from $58.9 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier.
The latest quarter included a gain of $56.1 million, or 59 cents a share, related to the purchase of the remaining 51% of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 

The strong performance, however, contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of NCNB's problem loans, particularly in the Southeast.
In the third quarter, nonperforming assets jumped to $474.1 million, or 1.43% of net loans and leases, from $232.8 million, or 1.13% in the second quarter.
Nonperformers totaled $230.8 million, or 1.27% in the year-ago third quarter.
Included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $33 million loan, which NCNB said it ""expects to be fully repaid, with no loss, early in the fourth quarter."" 

The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of 17% in NCNB's Southeast operations, as well as a 28% growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign.
The higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze NCNB's net interest margin in the Southeast to 3.38% from 3.80% a year earlier. 

In Big Board composite trading yesterday, NCNB jumped $3.50 a share, to $51.
Results were released after the market closed. 

NCNB Texas National, formed from the remnants of of the failed First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas, contributed $76.9 million to NCNB's bottom line in the third quarter.
NCNB said its third-quarter results reflect 100% of earnings of the Texas operation since Aug. 1. 

NCNB raised some $1.9 billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the NCNB Texas purchase, and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise.
Last week, the banking company said it purchased both Freedom Savings & Loan Association, Tampa, Fla., and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio, Texas, for $169.4 million. 

In the first nine months, NCNB's net income climbed 65% to $310.9 million, or $3.30 a share, from $188.2 million, or $2.22 a share, a year earlier. 

Security Pacific Corp. 

Security Pacific's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter, but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10% increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans. 

Net rose to $185.1 million, or $1.55 a share, from $167.9 million, or $1.47 a share, a year earlier.
The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $54 million increase in net interest income, reflecting a 33% increase in real estate loans (mainly residential), and a 19% rise in consumer loans.
These high-yielding loans in effect replaced some low-yielding assets such as inter-bank loans, which were allowed to decrease.
As a result, Security Pacific's net interest margin fell only 13 basis points, a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California, which have been reporting more sluggish earnings. 

Security Pacific shares closed at $44.625, down 37.5 cents, in Big Board composite trading. 

The earnings represent a 0.89% return on assets for Security Pacific, and an 18.9% return on equity. 

The loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed Arizona market.
Security Pacific reported a 33% increase in net credit losses for the quarter, to $109 million from $81.9 million in the year-ago period. 

Nonperforming loans grew slightly to $1.75 billion at Sept. 30, from $1.7 billion a year ago. 

Security Pacific's loan-loss provision was down 22%, or $30.4 million, because it added to its foreign-debt reserve the year before.
Non-interest income fell 6% in the quarter, mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of Hong Kong banking operations.
Non-interest expense grew only 4% in the period. 

For the nine months, net rose 17% to $548.9 million, or $4.67 a share, from $469.4 million, or $4.13 a share, a year earlier.

LIN Broadcasting Corp. said it won't take a position on a revised tender offer by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. to buy LIN and has asked for clarification of the offer. 

The new offer, which seeks 50.3% of the cellular and broadcasting concern, is for $125 a share for 22 million LIN shares.
McCaw's revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN. 

LIN is asking McCaw to clarify its tender offer, which challenges an agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN to merge their cellular-telephone businesses.
BellSouth has notified LIN that it would ""shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is warranted."" 

The LIN board said holders may be misled by the provision in the McCaw proposal that ""guarantees"" private market value after five years for the remaining shares.
McCaw has ""no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain,"" the LIN board said.
The board added that McCaw would be able to control LIN's operations and could, ""therefore, operate LIN in a manner which could diminish its private market value and attractiveness to a third-party purchaser in five years."" 

In national over-the-counter trading, LIN closed at $104.75, down $2.75.

A group of institutional investors in Telerate Inc. said that Dow Jones & Co. 's $18-a-share offer for the electronic financial information services company is ""grossly inadequate."" 

In a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group, which holds about 4.5 million Telerate shares, or about 4.7% of the shares outstanding, said "" . . . at present none of us believes an offer for less than $25 per share would be fair and some believe that $25 is too low."" The letter was dated Oct. 6. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Telerate shares closed yesterday at $18.875, down 75 cents a share. 

Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has launched an $18-a-share, or $576 million, tender offer to acquire the remaining Telerate shares outstanding; Dow Jones owns 67% of Telerate.
Telerate has rejected the offer, which expires Nov. 3. 

The group includes Putnam Cos. and various affiliates based in Boston; Wells Fargo Bank, San Francisco; the California Public Employees Retirement System, Sacramento, Calif., and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Baltimore. 

Among other issues, the group's letter said it has ""concerns as to whether Dow Jones's offer meets the applicable requirements of procedural fairness."" 

A spokesman for Dow Jones said he hadn't seen the group's filing, but added, ""obviously Dow Jones disagrees with their conclusions.
Our offer is to buy any and all shares tendered at $18 a share.""

U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the first dispute-settlement panel set up under the U.S.-Canadian ""free trade"" agreement has ruled that Canada's restrictions on exports of Pacific salmon and herring violate the accord. 

Mrs. Hills said the U.S. and Canada have until Nov. 13 to resolve the dispute.
If a solution isn't reached by then, she said, the U.S. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to Canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by U.S. fish-processing companies in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. 

However, in Ottawa, Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said the dispute-settlement panel accepted the ""legitimacy of Canada's position on the use of these landing requirements to conserve and manage these important fisheries."" 

Questioned about the seeming contradiction in the U.S. and Canadian government views of the panel's report, an aide for Mrs. Hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions ""are illegal."" 

The U.S. trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the Canadian export restrictions. 

Canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought ashore in British Columbia by commercial fishermen prior to export.
This action was defended by the Canadian government on conservation grounds. 

Mrs. Hills said yesterday that the dispute-settlement panel rejected this Canadian government argument. ""We fully expect that Canada will comply with the panel's ruling"" that the ""landing requirement"" also must be ended, she said. 

Earlier, an international panel set up under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva determined that the original Canadian fish-export restrictions violated GATT rules. 

Mrs. Hills said the U.S. won't accept any delays after Nov. 13 because U.S. fish-processing firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season's catch.
She said the Canadian restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded.

BancOklahoma Corp. said it completed a restructuring agreement previously agreed to by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., creditor banks and subordinated debenture holders. 

The plan would permit the bank holding company to retire its bank and debenture obligations through exchanges of cash and equity. 

The FDIC, which in 1986 provided $130 million in open-bank assistance to BancOklahoma's Bank of Oklahoma, Tulsa, unit will continue to maintain $90 million in preferred stock in the Tulsa bank unit.
In exchange for the other $40 million, the FDIC will receive additional warrants entitling it to buy 60% of BancOklahoma's common stock outstanding, up from the 55% option the FDIC received under terms of the 1986 capital infusion. 

In exchange for the $76 million they are owed, creditor banks will receive 3.9 million shares of BancOklahoma common stock and the proceeds from the future sales of four subsidiary banks to private buyers, the bank holding company said. 

Also under the agreement, debenture holders will get one million shares of common stock in exchange for $7.7 million in debentures and holders of BancOklahoma's series A preferred stock will receive 1.25 shares of common stock for every share of preferred they own, the company said.

BSN Corp. said it will begin an offer tomorrow to exchange up to one million of its common shares and all of its $16.6 million in 7 3/4% convertible debentures due 2001 for a package of new debt and common stock warrants. 

Under terms of the offer, the sporting goods maker will swap $9 face amount of 9 1/4% subordinated notes due 1996 and one warrant for each common share.
Each warrant allows the holder to buy one BSN share for $10.75 a share at any time over the next seven years.
BSN currently has 4.6 million common shares outstanding. 

BSN also is offering $850 face amount of new notes and 64 common-stock warrants for each $1,000 face amount of its convertible debt outstanding. 

The company said it can redeem the warrants at its option for $1 each.
The offer isn't contingent on a certain amount of debt or stock being exchanged. 

BSN said it is making the offer to shrink its capital and increase shareholder value.
If all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer, BSN will increase its debt by $9 million, but it also will recognize a $2 million gain from retiring the old debt, said Michael J. Blumenfeld, president. ""We have sufficient cash flow to handle that,"" he said. 

The offers are scheduled to expire in mid to late November.

Merrill Lynch & Co. 's net income dropped 37%, while Bear Stearns Cos. posted a 7.5% gain in net, and PaineWebber Group Inc. 's profit fell, but would have risen without a special gain a year ago. 

At Merrill Lynch, third-period net was $41 million, or 34 cents a share, down from $65.6 million, or 58 cents a share, a year ago.
Total revenue reached $2.83 billion, up 10% from $2.57 billion. 

The firm's drop in net reflected weaker revenue in transactions for its own account -- a decline of 19% to $314.6 million on reduced revenue from trading fixed-income securities.
Investment banking revenue fell 22% to $296.6 million on fewer equity and municipal underwritings. 

Merrill Lynch's commission revenue grew 21%, however, to $462.8 million, on higher share prices and volume and on strong sales of mutual funds.
Revenue derived from interest and dividends jumped 30% to $1.4 billion.
Asset-management fee revenue grew 12% to $151 million. 

The brokerage also reported a loss of $2.2 million from the discontinued operations and disposal of its Fine Homes International Limited Partnership real-estate subsidiary. 

Bear Stearns said net in the first quarter ended Sept. 29 reached $22.1 million, or 23 cents a share, from $20.5 million, or 20 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
Gross revenue rose 21% to $580.4 million from $478.9 million. 

Profit from trading for its own account dropped, the securities firm said.
Investment banking revenue climbed 25%, while commission revenue advanced 31% on a stronger retail market.
Bear Stearns is the holding company for Bear, Stearns & Co., the investment banking and brokerage firm. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Bear Stearns shares closed at $13.625, down 25 cents. 

Separately, PaineWebber posted net income for the third quarter of $16.8 million, or 41 cents a share, reflecting a ""broad-based improvement"" in the company's core businesses.
Retail profit surged, but the company said it was only a ""modest contributor"" to third-quarter results. 

A year ago, net at the New York investment banking firm was $20.9 million, or 50 cents a share, including a special pretax gain of $46.3 million from the sale of the company's interest in National Car Rental Systems Inc.

The market upheaval apparently hasn't triggered any cash crunch -- yet. 

Individual investors, investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive; those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans.
But several large banks said yesterday they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that would signal such difficulties. 

""We're seeing nothing out of the ordinary,"" said one official at a Top 10 bank. ""That's good news, because we all swim in this water."" Added another executive at a big bank: ""We were all a little goosey over the weekend trying to forecast what would happen {Monday}, but it's been very quiet.

What happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another meltdown in prices.
No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling.
But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency. 

After the 1987 plunge, markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose.
The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers: If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day, the exchange will halt trading for one hour; if the decline hits 400 points, the exchange will close for an additional two hours.
The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies, calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels. 

It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic.
A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself.
But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices. 

What happened Friday was the worst of all worlds.
The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes, after the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points, or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index.
Options markets stopped trading in many securities.
The New York Stock Exchange, under its own rules, remained open. 

With nowhere else to go, sellers, and particularly program traders, focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange.
As liquidity on that market weakened, prices fell sharply. 

Had the futures and options markets been open, additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline, most probably, would have been less intense.
At 3:30, after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington, the futures exchanges reopened.
Futures trading, however, was halted altogether at 3:45, after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points, which is the daily limit for price declines.
At this point, the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange. 

It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange, the futures markets and the options markets, though physically separate, have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively.
Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them.
It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers.
To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility, either all markets should be open to trading or none. 

Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday, but they probably would have made for smoother, less volatile executions.
It's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open.
Let's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline. 

The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets.
The new circuit breakers, if they are to be applied at all, will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open.
The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies.
Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (which, with the SEC, regulates the Chicago stock-index markets) be unable to agree, the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary. 

In many ways, our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago.
The New York Stock Exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day.
Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers, and specialists -- who I believe should stay, despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions. (Of course, specialists' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices.
Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell orders.) But the task of improving market performance remains unfinished.

A UNIFIED EUROPE poses labor problems and prospects for U.S. firms. 

The ""social dimension"" -- worker concerns -- of the European Community's plan to open its internal borders in 1992 could set the effort ""off the rails"" if not done reasonably, says General Electric senior vice president Frank Doyle.
U.S. companies wanting to expand in Europe face ""tough pressure"" from unions in nations such as West Germany, which play a big consulting role in management decisions, he says. 

FMC Corp. and Baxter International say unions also won't like plant relocations and needed restructuring, which means layoffs.
Many employers have already begun moving to southern countries such as Spain and Italy, where wages are low and unions are weaker; demand for trained labor and managers will rise there, FMC says.

CLUBBING A FAN wasn't the Baltimore Orioles' fault. 

So said a federal judge, in a case involving two players for the minor league Bluefield, Va., Orioles, a Baltimore farm team.
The players were heckled by a patron during a July 4, 1988, game with the Martinsville Phillies.
Like its parent that year, ""Bluefield was not having a good year,"" the judge said.
After the game (""Bluefield lost, 9-8, stranding three runners in . . . the ninth,"" he noted), trouble began. 

More taunting in the parking lot, the players said, led to a fight.
The fan said he was punched and kicked by one player and that the other broke his jaw with a baseball bat.
The judge dismissed the fan's suit against the team, however, ruling the Orioles innocent of negligent hiring, and not responsible for a fight that was outside the players' employment. 

PROPOSALS ARISE for coping with the shortage of nurses. 

An Association of Academic Health Centers report urges freeing nurses from duties that don't require special skills.
It also recommends better retirement and day-care benefits, and basing pay on education, experience and nurses' demanding work schedules.
But it opposes an American Medical Association proposal for creating a ""registered care technologist,"" as ""potentially divisive""; it says the job would entail an unwanted new doctor's ""bedside"" extension. 

Over a third of 618 hospitals surveyed by consultant Hewitt Associates use a ""clinical ladder,"" basing advancement on performance and education.

CURBING WAGE BOOSTS will get high priority again in 1990 collective bargaining, a Bureau of National Affairs survey of 250 companies with pacts expiring next year indicates.
Despite labor-shortage warnings, 80% aim for first-year wage increases of under 4%; and 77% say they'd try to replace workers, if struck, or would consider it. 

TEMPORARY WORKERS have good educations, the National Association of Temporary Services says; its survey of 2,508 such employees shows 82% with more than a high-school education, and 31% with college degrees.
About 12% have retired from a full-time job, while 54% were asked to stay on full time. 

HOME-SALE LOSSES rise, but they're often covered by employers. 

But they search for ways to limit the damage.
A third of 439 companies surveyed by the Employee Relocation Council report a rise in 1988 sales losses over 1987.
About 72% reimburse for all or some losses.
Since 1984, more companies give sales-loss aid, as many real-estate values depreciated, the council says.
RJR Nabisco pays up to $30,000 of losses, including improvements.
Goodrich won't ensure loss coverage, but will prevent a ""catastrophic loss""; it has given some employees the full purchase price when values fell from concern over dangers posed by a disposal site.
Federal Express, Dow Chemical, Ford and National City Corp. will buy the home or let the worker sell to an outside firm, but usually won't cover a loss. 

Since 1984, firms offering prepurchase house appraisals, to deter overpaying, rose to 40% of those the council polled, from 28%.

Yesterday was, in the words of New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan Jr., just your ""reasonably normal, 400 million-share, up 88-points day."" 

When it was all over and stocks had staged a huge recovery, Big Board officials were self-congratulatory about how well the day had gone.
They said the exchange's trading procedures, personnel, equipment and links with other exchanges couldn't have performed better. 

""We had no operating problems at all,"" Mr. Phelan said after the market closed. ""All the things that we set up to slow down the process, to let people know that the market was in an extreme position, worked extremely well."" 

Prices for the 416.3 million shares that changed hands during the session were carried on the exchange's trading tape with barely a delay, officials said.
While reaching blockbuster proportions yesterday, the volume was still well within the 600 million-share capacity that the exchange has said it can handle daily since beefing up its computers after the October 1987 crash. 

The so-called circuit breakers devised by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to quell free falls in stock and futures prices weren't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day. 

Despite traders' complaints, Mr. Phelan said the links with the Chicago futures market worked as planned in Friday's rout to provide a cooling-off period.
Of greater help, the Big Board chairman said, was the ""natural circuit breaker"" of the weekend, that provided a breathing period that ""brought rationality back to the market.""

Chicken Chains Ruffled 

By Loss of Customers 

FAST-FOOD chicken chains, faced with a worsening business slump, are struggling to hatch some new marketing strategies. 

The Crest Report, which tracks consumer purchases, says customer traffic at chicken restaurants fell 10% in the second quarter, while the overall fast-food customer count was down 2%. 

Chicken business is off largely because of more competition from grocery-store convenience food, home-delivered pizza and other takeout fare, says a spokesman for the report, a publication of NPD Group, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y. 

The loss of more customers is the latest in a string of problems.
Church's Fried Chicken Inc. and Popeye's Famous Fried Chicken Inc., which have merged, are still troubled by overlapping restaurant locations. 

Chicken chains also are feeling more pressure from McDonald's Corp., which introduced its McChicken sandwich this year and recently tested the sale of individual pieces of chicken. 

New management at Kentucky Fried Chicken, a unit of PepsiCo Inc., has fought back with new medium and large chicken sandwiches for the lunch crowd.
And the chain is testing products that aren't fried, such as ""char-grilled"" chicken, to try to win health-conscious consumers. 

Kentucky Fried Chicken also is testing home-delivery of chicken, which could be a hit with stay-at-home diners.
But some fast-food industry analysts say problems with keeping chicken warm and fresh must be solved first. 

A Kentucky Fried Chicken spokesman, however, disputed the notion that the delivery service experienced problems in some markets where testing has been discontinued.
He says the test is continuing in Chicago, Columbus, Ohio, and a few other cities. 

The advertising industry is buzzing with rumors that Kentucky Fried Chicken will drop Young & Rubicam and seek a new ad agency.
But the company declines to comment. 

Emanuel Goldman, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst, predicts Kentucky Fried Chicken will post an 11% drop in 1989 net income. ""They've been laggard,"" he says, ""but they'll have to become more aggressive."" 

Reluctant Advertisers 

Try Soft-Sell Spots 

CALL IT un-advertising.
Pittsburgh consultant David Bear is selling a soft approach to clients who want exposure yet shun pushy ads. 

His ploy: 60-second radio spots that offer helpful hints.
The only plug for the sponsor is a brief mention at the end of the spot. 

The messages resemble the Business Traveler, a daily dose of travel tips developed by Mr. Bear and sponsored by travel agencies in several major cities. 

New un-advertisers include Burt Hill Kosar Rittlemann Associates, a Butler, Pa., architectural firm.
Its radio series features such spots as ""Floodlights: Evening Wear for Urban Structures"" and ""Building a Place to Park."" A harder sell, says John Kosar, the firm's president, would ""detract from the profession."" 

Hospitals have signed up to use the messages to promote fundraisers, and Equitable Gas Co. is considering the format to offer energy tips to consumers. 

But such spots can be too soft. ""There's always a risk of lost messages,"" says John Fitzgerald, chairman of Ketchum Advertising USA, which created similar radio spots for Pittsburgh National Bank. ""It's a question of how much credibility you gain for the possible loss of recognition."" 

Retailer Sees Pitfalls 

In Environmental Push 

HERE'S a retailer that's getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products. 

Big Bear Supermarkets Inc., a grocery chain based in San Diego, plans to display shelf cards and distribute pamphlets recommending products deemed safe for the environment.
The choices will be based on research by the San Diego Environmental Health Coalition and will include products like Murphy's Oil Soap and other noncorrosive cleaners. 

But the chain is quickly realizing the pitfalls of such endorsements.
For example, it recommends nonchlorinated dishwasher detergent and puts Sunlight on its environmentally safe list. 

That doesn't thrill Procter & Gamble Co., maker of Cascade dishwasher detergent.
A company spokesman questioned the validity of the list, noting that chlorine is present in all major dishwasher detergents.
In fact, Lever Bros. confirms that its Sunlight brand does contain chlorine bleach, even though it isn't listed on the label for the powder version.
Thomas G. Dahlen, Big Bear's executive vice president, said the chain is still reviewing its product list to avoid such problems. ""Our intent is to promote the best alternative,"" he says. ""And it's important that we be accurate."" 

But in the end, customers' wishes are what will prevail.
Big Bear doesn't care for disposable diapers, which aren't biodegradable.
Yet parents demand them.
Says Mr. Dahlen, ""We'll still be forced to sell items we might not philosophically agree with.""

Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has chosen Antonia Novello to be the next surgeon general, Bush administration officials said. 

If she is nominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate, Dr. Novello would succeed C. Everett Koop, who rattled liberals and conservatives alike with his outspoken views on a range of health issues. 

Dr. Novello, an expert on pediatric kidney diseases, is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
She has also served on several task forces on acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 

Dr. Novello's office said she wouldn't talk with reporters, and it refused to release any information about her.
The newsletter Medicine & Health, which first disclosed her selection by Dr. Sullivan, said she is 44 years old and she studied at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine.

The continuing series of HUD scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork-barrel politics.
Nevertheless, lobbies such as the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) continue to pressure Capitol Hill for more special-interest spending. 

Kent Colton, NAHB executive vice president, argues that the U.S. faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- reduced affordability of homes for first-time buyers, increased homelessness, and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be ""very difficult"" to solve ""without expanded federal resources."" 

There's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending.
But the NAHB was created in 1943 out of an organization that made its name fighting a Roosevelt administration proposal to take over all defense housing production.
Through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer's coalition, pushing for such initiatives as the balanced-budget amendment.
Yet on matters close to, er, home . . . 

""The HUD budget has dropped by more than 70% since 1980,"" argues Mr. Colton. ""We've taken more than our fair share.
I wouldn't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit."" 

But NAHB support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch; over the years the NAHB has backed a host of public programs.
It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced anti-recession housing measures.
Moreover, explains one HUD official, the NAHB remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production. 

The association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish-list, which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $15 billion annually. 

It would like to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95% of the median price in a particular market, instead of limiting it to $101,250; reduce (or even eliminate) FHA down-payment requirements and increase the availability of variable-rate mortgages; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program; provide ""adequate"" funding for the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA); increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing, including $4 billion in block grants to states and localities; and ""fully fund"" the McKinney Act, a $656 million potpourri for the homeless. 

Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past, and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists, as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal, or congressmen.
Indirect subsidies, through the FHA, for instance, are little better. 

Though Mr. Colton says expanding FHA lending would result in ""no cost to the government,"" the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing (such as low-income) to the single-family home market would result in a major expense.
More important, housing programs run by HUD, the VA, and FmHA are awash in red ink.
The FHA alone lost $4.2 billion in fiscal 1988; the government's equity in the agency, essentially its reserve fund, fell to minus $2.9 billion.
The federal government has had to pump in $2.28 billion into the VA housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the VA requested an additional $120 million for the fiscal year just ended.
All told, the federal government already guarantees more than $900 billion of mortgages. 

In its nicely produced publication ""Where Will Our Children Live?"" the NAHB does acknowledge that ""of course, the full measure of housing affordability cannot be provided by the federal government."" It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation, particularly zoning and building fees, which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle-income people.
But while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers, the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to, say, its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate counterproductive controls. 

The association, a majority of whose 156,000 members build fewer than 25 units a year, is like many other business lobbies.
Explains Sheila MacDonald of the National Taxpayers Union: ""It treads in two worlds.
The builders like the subsidies, but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues, such as the balanced-budget amendment."" Unfortunately, the organization's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility.
Two years ago when the NAHB lobbied for the $19 billion omnibus housing bill, the organization ""basically dropped out of the taxpayers' coalition,"" says Ms. MacDonald.
As Mr. Colton of the NAHB acknowledges: ""Government is not going to solve the problem. . . . The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down."" More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies.
Is this what the home builders want?

In an attempt to give new momentum to European Community plans for a single currency, EC government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on amending the EC's founding Treaty of Rome. 

According to diplomatic sources in Brussels, most EC leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990, and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in Strasbourg, France, on Dec. 8 and 9. 

The only strong opposition to changing the EC treaty comes from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who is opposed to creating a single EC currency.
But the process of convening the intergovernmental conference doesn't require unanimity. 

Setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself, but could be viewed as an important psychological push.
French President Francois Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June, but the move was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 

Diplomatic sources said Mr. Kohl may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that West Germany is still committed to EC unity.

The latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke T. Boone Pickens tells about the guy who was run over by the parade.
When asked ""What went wrong?"" the unfortunate victim replied, ""It was a combination of things."" And so it was on Gray Friday. 

The grand marshal of this parade would appear to have been excess leverage.
Even if that is so, however, it's probably the case that no barriers should have been erected to stop the procession before the end of the rout(e). 

The ceremonies began Friday afternoon when word spread that the UAL buy-out was collapsing.
Although the union-bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer, consisting of less cash, the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending. 

Lots of other entries made up the parade, of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices, signalling Federal Reserve tightness; and the Bush administration's (temporary?) defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax.
As usual, few favorable reviews were heard for that ever-present marching band of program traders, although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write. 

What really spooked the crowds along Wall Street, however, was the sudden concern that, whatever the reason, the pool of debt capital is drying up.
Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers, rather than the small investor, as their highly margined investments in the ""deal"" stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing. 

Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses.
UAL, which triggered the slide, opened Monday at $224, down about 20% from Thursday's close.
AMR opened Monday at $80, down nearly 20% from Thursday's close. (Both took further hits yesterday.) Hilton lost 20% on Friday; Paramount lost almost 11%.
A careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured, the target's stock price was not affected on Friday.
The multibillion-dollar prospects, where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and/or issue billions in high-yield debt, were where the damage was concentrated. 

The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday's dramatic march for several weeks.
The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers, such as Resorts International, Integrated Resources, and Campeau's retailing empire, have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities.
Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio Mattress and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring.
As a result, high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $11 billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times. 

These are all market excesses (putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity), and what we've seen is the market reining them in.
Of course, Washington hadn't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle, and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect, but those preliminary steps shouldn't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday. 

If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday, what are the implications for policy makers?
After all, the stock market's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators.
Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington's bashing of Wall Street?
Absolutely not. 

To the extent that Friday's sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage, the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior.
The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings.
The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate. 

If takeover premiums become excessive, if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive, then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers, and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions.
Yes, the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral, but they rode the tiger up all year.
Not surprisingly, he sometimes bites. 

The arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on Gray Friday, while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily.
If you identify with the besieged managers, you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington.
If you side with the arbitragers and raiders, you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators, although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated. 

The truth is, Washington understands politics better than economics.
Although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from Washington's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging, actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm.
Any such attempt to distinguish ""good debt"" from ""bad debt,"" or to draw the line at a particular industry, such as the airlines, is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general. 

Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs, Panama and the deficit, all of them parades that seem never to end.

Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning, with the Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks rising 618.69 points to close the morning session at 35087.38.
The index slid 647.33 points, or 1.8%, on Monday. 

In the first 25 minutes of Tuesday's trading the Nikkei index soared 664.83 points, to 35133.83.
By 10 a.m. Tokyo time, the index was up 435.11 points, to 34903.80 as investors hailed New York's overnight rally. 

Monday's slide came in a relatively calm session that didn't provide much direction for other markets. 

Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe, particularly in Frankfurt, although London and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in New York.
Other Asian and Pacific markets had sharper losses than Tokyo, but the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash. 

All eyes were on Tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market to trade since Friday's 190.58-point plunge on Wall Street.
But rather than set the tone for other markets, Japan's major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines.
Still, despite the sudden reappearance of stock-market turbulence, managers of Japanese investment funds said they weren't planning to unload U.S. or European equities. 

""We didn't trade much today, as our policy now is to wait and see,"" said a fund manager at Taisho Life Insurance Co. ""We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York."" 

The institutions appeared confident that Japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary, and there was considerable speculation during the day that the Finance Ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that.
But in the absence of panicky trading, its presence was never overtly felt. 

At the close, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at 34468.69, down 647.33 points, or 1.8%.
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank 45.66, or 1.7%, to 2600.88.
The day's decline was generally in line with analysts' weekend predictions.
Declining issues swamped advancers, 941-105.
But volume was thin at 526.2 million shares, compared with 574.7 million Friday. 

The market opened sharply lower, with the Nikkei average down nearly 600 after 20 minutes.
A midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session, but the rally failed in the afternoon, and the market closed near the day's low. 

The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell 100.96, or 2.7%, to 3655.40.
Many investors, trying to outperform the market's major indexes, have flocked to these small issues in recent weeks. 

Japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the Tokyo market didn't fall more sharply.
But its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two years ago, during the October 1987 global stock market crash. 

On Oct. 16, 1987 -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the New York market dropped 4.6%, and Tokyo followed on Monday with a 2.4% drop.
This time, Wall Street's plunge of 6.9% Friday was followed by yesterday's 1.8% loss in Tokyo. 

Two years ago, Tokyo's biggest fall came the day after New York's 22.6% Black Monday plunge, when the Nikkei average fell 14.9%.
Thus, market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to Wall Street's opening.
But in New York yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 88.12 to close at 2657.38 on heavy volume of 416,290,000 shares, although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market. 

Nobuto Yasuda, a director at Yamaichi Investment Trust & Management Co., called yesterday's session ""a good scenario"" for Japan. ""Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders,"" he said. ""For us institutional investors, the chance for buying has come."" 

Isao Ushikubo, general manager of the investment research department at Toyo Trust & Banking Co., also was optimistic.
He described Friday's plunge in the U.S. as a ""fleeting"" event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity. 

""Unless there is a panic, this is the best time to buy, as was the case two years ago,"" he said. ""Those shares which had posted gains on M&A speculation were dashed with cold water, but as far as major stocks are concerned, there isn't much impact."" 

Other fund managers were similarly sanguine. ""We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities,"" said Masato Murakami, chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at Yasuda Trust & Banking Co.
He said Friday's Wall Street decline was ""well within the range of volatility"" that Yasuda Trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy. 

Among other Asian and Pacific markets, Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses, with the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia falling 11.5% and Singapore's Straits Times Industrial Index down 10%.
Major indexes declined more than 8% in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5% in Hong Kong.
Bangkok, Manila, Seoul, Taipei and Jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses. 

Brokers and fund managers said the region's markets were reacting to Friday's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond market. 

""It's pure psychology,"" said William Au Yeung, an account executive for Drexel Burnham Lambert (HK) Ltd. in Hong Kong. ""Markets in this region aren't so geared to leveraged buy-outs, and their economies generally are in good shape, but there's no doubt that Asia is still following America's lead."" 

Several analysts said Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows.
Hong Kong is the region's next most open market, but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China. 

""Singapore took the hit because when people want to get out, they tend to go where the liquidity is,"" said Elizabeth Hambrecht, a regional analyst with Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd.
She pointed out that even after Monday's 10% decline, the Straits Times index is up 24% this year, so investors who bailed out generally did so profitably.
Similarly, Kuala Lumpur's composite index yesterday ended 27.5% above its 1988 close. 

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 180.60 to finish at 2601.70.
Trading was heavy at about one billion shares, compared with 473.9 million Friday.
But the session was orderly, in contrast to the market's four-day closure after the 1987 crash. 

Richard Chenevix-Trench, a director at Hong Kong-based Baring International Fund Managers Ltd., said the market probably hasn't hit bottom yet but is close. ""If New York doesn't collapse, I see maybe another 5% on the downside, not counting the risk of bad news out of China,"" he said. 

In Australia, Sydney's All Ordinaries index closed at 1601.5, down 8.1%, its biggest drop since October 1987.
But volume rose only to 162 million shares from 143 million Friday. 

Nestor Hinzack, an analyst at brokerage firm Burdett, Buckeridge & Young Ltd., described the market's performance as ""sheep-like"" as investors fled to bluechip Australian stocks and shunned entrepreneurial companies they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price. 

London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, the most closely watched market barometer, ended at its intraday high of 2163.4, down 70.5, or 3.2%.
At its low, shortly before Wall Street opened, it was off more than 130 points. 

The Financial Times 30-share index closed 79.3 points lower at 1738.7.
Volume more than doubled to 959.3 million shares from 457.7 million Friday. 

Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading.
The decline in the German Stock Index of 203.56 points, or 12.8%, to 1385.72 was the Frankfurt market's steepest fall ever. 

Retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale, pushing some blue-chip shares down as much as 20%.
Analysts cited memories of two years ago, when many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash but the West German market continued to decline steeply for the next three months.

Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side, everything loose would end up in California.
We've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California's vitality, but maybe the state's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place.
What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state's attorney general? 

If passed by the voters, the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides, reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40%, ban new offshore drilling, ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer, and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $40 million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too dirty.
The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby: the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment.
Interestingly, the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one. 

Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed.
The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that don't meet the initiative's standards.
Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market.
In other words, California is presuming to take control of the nation's farm policy. 

As usual the green lobby's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality.
Consider the greenhouse-effect provision.
The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40%.
Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory, it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem. 

But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative, what is going on?
The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit.
The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp.
He's running for governor. 

Mr. Van de Kamp is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6, 1990.
That's also the day of the gubernatorial election. 

The initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy Hollywood weepers who donate money.
And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits.
He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative (on which there are no limits) is gravy.
This initiative is being labeled The Big Green, but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback. (The Republican candidate, Sen. Pete Wilson, is playing the initiative fundraising game too, sponsoring his own crime initiative.) 

While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional, it is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through.
This is the state that recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative.
If this new proposal ever does become law, the green lobby will benefit directly. 

The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he doesn't like.
That means the NRDC and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation; taxpayers would bear the cost. 

Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of California's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific, anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric.
Of course the state's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves.
George Bush, for example, may decide that he doesn't want to be the President who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from California.
And some other segments of California's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs. 

This grandiose initiative will help California define itself for the futureeither as a state still tethered to economic and scientific reality, or as one being led to wherever its la-la activists want to take it.

First, there was a death watch.
Then exhilaration. 

Spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday's 190.58-point plunge, gaining 88.12 to 2657.38.
It was the fourth-biggest advance for the average of 30 blue chips, on frenetic New York Stock Exchange volume of 416,290,000 shares -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash. 

While the advance cheered investors who feared a 1987-style crash would occur yesterday, it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders.
A troubling sign: Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers, 975 to 749, and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday's late Big Board plunge.
The Nasdaq OTC index closed down 6.31 to 460.98. 

Meanwhile, in a divergence in two of the market's most important indicators, the Dow industrials' sister average, the 20-stock Dow Jones Transportation Average, tumbled 102.06 to 1304.23 -- its second-worst decline next to the 164.78-point fall during the 1987 crash. 

Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks, UAL and AMR, which each fell more than 20% when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon.
UAL, the takeover stock at the center of Friday's 190.58-point market plunge, fell 56 7/8 to 222 7/8 on nearly 2.3 million shares. 

Overall, ""this is a pleasant rally but it's very selective,"" said Arthur Cashin Jr., a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board. ""Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory.
It's just a strange feeling.
I don't think anyone left the place whistling Dixie."" 

The rally gave credence, at least for now, to the pre-trading declaration of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. that Friday's market debacle was ""an abnormal condition, and not a disaster."" 

But to traders, it looked like disaster on the 9:30 a.m. opening bell. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 1.64 shortly after 9:30.
But most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average, including Eastman Kodak and General Motors, couldn't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday's late-afternoon rout.
At 9:45, Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow bellwethers of late -- opened down 2 3/4 to 117. 

The Dow dropped to a quick 27-point loss, and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble. 

More stocks opened over the ensuing half hour, as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood. 

Then, to make matters worse, computerized sell programs kicked in, hammering stocks into steeper losses.
There was heavy stock-index arbitrage, as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets.
This was a hangover from Friday, when Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks.
The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized.
They didn't.
The Dow accelerated its slide, losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading. 

With program traders seemingly in charge, buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall. 

Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound, and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall.
And this time, it wasn't just the program traders who were responsible.
All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily.
The program traders were in there, too, of course.
But according to one trader, the programmers ""didn't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was {also} a lot of bargain-hunting"" by institutions. 

Roland M. Machold, director of the New Jersey Division of Investment, which oversees $29 billion in investments, said the ""first thing we did was to double our orders"" yesterday morning. ""With the market down like this, we'll probably take another $50 million and put it in"" the market. 

Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders' eyes.
According to Big Board officials, Disney had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday; it was one of the seven stocks that couldn't finish trading that day.
The stock opened late at 114 1/2, down 8 1/2.
But then it shot upward 7 1/2 as Goldman, Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought, traders said.
However, Disney specialist Robert Fagenson said: ""I would be surprised if Goldman represented 4% of the opening volume."" 

Around Wall Street, trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday, in contrast to Friday's gridlock.
At Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., head equity trader Dudley Eppel said: ""I think the opening was constructive.
It was orderly.
We put some orders together.
There wasn't a lot of panic selling, either domestically or internationally. . . .Not like Friday where they just took {the market} apart."" 

Still, the market hadn't yet crossed into positive territory, and traders were glum.
But in another dramatic burst, the Dow tacked on 42 points in five minutes, and at 10:25 the index showed a gain of 5.74. 

On the Big Board floor and on trading desks, traders yelped their approval.
Grinned Griffith Peck, a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's OTC department: ""I tell you, this market acts healthy."" Around him, scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy; their boss broke out bottles of Perrier water to cool them off. 

Among Big Board specialists, the cry was ""Pull your offers"" -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares. 

""It was bedlam on the upside,"" said one Big Board specialist. 

But not everybody was making money.
The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the nation's major options market, was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted Friday.
Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday, and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses.
Over the weekend, clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning. 

""They were absolutely killed, slaughtered,"" said one Chicago-based options trader. 

Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index, whose 20 stocks mimic the Dow industrials, didn't lead yesterday's big rally. 

James Gallagher, a partner at specialist Fowler & Rosenau, said, ""The difference between today and two years ago"" -- ""Terrible Tuesday,"" Oct. 20, 1987 -- ""is that then we needed a savior to go into the Major Market Index, spend $2 million and get the program rally started.
This time {institutions} saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away.
Then when the market was at a technical level to buy, they came in with a vengeance."" 

However, according to one analyst, the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday. ""Futures were pulling the stock market higher,"" said Donald Selkin, head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 

Although the Big Board's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session, their performance yesterday was better than during Friday's late-afternoon chaos, according to traders and brokers who work with them. 

Specialists were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the Friday plunge.
But yesterday, even with halts in such major blue-chip stocks as Merck, ""we expected (the halts) and it wasn't too bad,"" said Donaldson's Mr. Eppel, who had been critical of the specialists' performance on Friday.
According to a Big Board official, while many stocks opened late, there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues -- AMR, Merck and Valero Energy.
Merck is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index. 

No sector of the market has been spared during the past two days' gyrations.
Yet from the Dow industrials' high on Oct. 9 through Friday's plunge, relatively good performances have been turned in by real-estate, utilities, precious metals and life insurance stocks.
And yesterday, the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues.
For example, Halliburton jumped 3 1/4 to 38, Schlumberger rose 2 1/2 to 43 1/4 and Baker Hughes rose 1 1/8 to 22. 

Because of the UAL and AMR tumbles, airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday. 

Philip Morris was the Big Board's most active issue, rising 2 1/4 to 43 1/4 on nearly eight million shares. 

Among other major issues, Coca-Cola Co. closed up 2 at 66 3/4 on 1.7 million shares and American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3 1/4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares.
Shares of International Business Machines, which reported earnings yesterday, finished at 103, up 1, after slipping below 100 during Friday's session for the first time in five years. 

Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings.
Merrill Lynch added 1 3/4 to 28, PaineWebber rose 3/4 to 18 1/2 and Bear Stearns rose 3/8 to 14 1/4. 

Federal National Mortgage Association, a recently hot stock, climbed 4 to 124 on nearly 1.6 million shares. 

At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday, the Big Board's Mr. Phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel. 

Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies weren't responsible for triggering Friday's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months.
Some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded in the final 90 minutes of Friday's session, when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated, were program-related, he said. 

Program trades make up 10% of the exchange's volume on an average day, but despite the increase Friday, it was ""certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline,"" Mr. Phelan said. 

Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday. ""Obviously, every time we get this kind of reaction, it's going to make everybody nervous, including me,"" he said.
He said that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout the weekend and that ""all the participants behaved very, very responsibly today."" 

Meanwhile, Peter DaPuzzo, Shearson's head of retail equity trading, praised institutional investors in the OTC market, who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors. ""The institutions can't be criticized for their behavior,"" Mr. DaPuzzo said in an interview. ""It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19.
They used their judgment.
They didn't panic during the first round of selling this morning.
Instead, they bought on weakness and sold into the strength, which kept the market orderly.
Maybe they learned from experience."" 

Mr. Phelan said the performance of specialists during Friday's plunge was admirable, because out of 1,640 Big Board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and weren't reopened before the close. ""They did an excellent job,"" Mr. Phelan said of the specialists.
Wall Street traders on Friday had complained about the trading suspensions.

West Germany's Green Party joined its ideological soulmates Jeremy Rifkin and the Christic Institute in the legal battle to ground the Atlantis shuttle and its plutonium-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter.

A House-Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii. 

The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic, and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less.
The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a face-saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry, which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years. 

By a 6-4 margin, House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights.
But the six-hour compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions.
As a practical matter, flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit, but the language would exempt longer routes beginning, for example, in Chicago or on the East Coast. 

Within the Senate, the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.), who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative.
The measure is attached to the more than $26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. Lautenberg's jurisdiction, and the final compromise is laced with more than $205 million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports, including Denver. 

From the outset, the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow.
But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states, such as North Carolina.
Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House, and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban. 

Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest, the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane, but politically important, projects of members.
In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees, the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida, Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor. ""Anybody can vote as they want,"" said Rep. William Lehman (D., Fla.), head of the House conferees. ""But if you make a request, you should support the committee."" 

Within the Federal Aviation Administration, the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20% from last year, and total operations would rise to $3.84 billion -- a 12% boost.
The facilities account includes $40 million for Denver's ambitious new airport, and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver, United and Continental. 

Leery of the costs -- and, critics say, competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver. 

Texas Air Corp., which owns Continental, and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying.
The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50% of the gates.
But this was rejected in favor of much looser language directing the Transportation Department to review the costs of the first phase, expected to cost about $2 billion. 

Though smaller in total dollars, the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $30.6 million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports.
The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program, but the list of qualified airports would be cut by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy.
Congress previously cut six airports this year.
The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $200 for each passenger in subsidies. 

Among rail and highway accounts, the agreement provides $615 million for Amtrak, including $85 million for capital improvements.
And federal-formula grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen at $1.625 billion, or $20 million more than last fiscal year.

Enjoying several blockbuster movie hits including ""Batman,"" Los Angeles-based Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. reported earnings for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 of $5.8 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss. 

Sony Corp., which has offered to acquire the movie-production company, is seeking to free its top executives, Peter Guber and Jon Peters, from an exclusive agreement with Time Warner Inc. 's Warner Communications Inc. so they can run Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. 

Sony two weeks ago agreed to acquire Columbia for $3.4 billion, or $27 a share.
Warner sued Sony and Guber-Peters late last week; Sony and Guber-Peters have countersued, charging Warner with attempting to interfere in Sony's acquisition of the two companies. 

Guber-Peters's net income in the latest quarter compared with a net loss of $6.9 million, or 62 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
The company said revenue rose 138%, to $10.9 million from $4.6 million, reflecting the success of its movies ""Gorillas in the Mist"" and ""Rainman,"" as well as the box-office smash ""Batman.""

Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland, so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package.
Last month, the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature, the Sejm, in democratic procedures.
Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort ""the first gift of democracy."" The Poles might do better to view it as a Trojan Horse.
It is the vast shadow government of 15,000 congressional staffers that helps create such legislative atrocities as the 1,376 page, 13-pound reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the United States.
Maybe after the staffers explain their work to the Poles, they'd be willing to come back and do the same for the American people.

Waterford Wedgwood PLC, a financially troubled Irish maker of fine crystal and Wedgwood china, reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to 10.6 million Irish punts ($14.9 million) from 5.8 million Irish punts a year earlier. 

The results for the half were worse than market expectations, which suggested an interim loss of around 10 million Irish punts.
In a sharply weaker London market yesterday, Waterford shares were down 15 pence at 50 pence (79 cents). 

The company reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of 14 million Irish punts, compared with a loss of 9.3 million Irish punts for the year-earlier period.
There weren't any extraordinary items. 

Sales for the total group rose 27% to 168.1 million Irish punts compared with 132.6 million Irish punts a year ago.
Waterford has decided against paying an interim dividend. 

Waterford said the appointment of a new management team and the signing of a comprehensive labor agreement are expected to enhance the company's long-term prospects.

The sudden ""flight to quality"" that triggered Friday's explosive bond-market rally was reversed yesterday in a ""flight from quality"" rout. 

The setback, in which Treasury bond prices plummeted, reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit-taking. 

""It was a pretty wild day.
Our markets were closely tied to the stock market,"" said Joel Kazis, manager of trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ""Friday's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs,"" he said. 

Some fixed-income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly 200-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday.
That caused investors to flee stocks and buy high-quality Treasury bonds, which are safer than other types of securities.
But when stocks began to climb instead, prices of Treasury bonds declined. 

Contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios.
Among the firms were Merrill Lynch & Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 

The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1/2%.
The closely watched rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks, slid to about 8 3/4% last week, down from its perceived target level of about 9%.
The rate is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy.
Traders said yesterday's modest easing didn't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected.
In fact, some economists contend that the latest easing started last week.
Others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing. 

The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, ended about 1 3/4 points lower, or down about $17.50 for each $1,000 face amount.
The reversal was even more evident among shorter-term Treasury securities.
After Treasury bill rates plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage point on Friday, they gave back three-fourths of that amount yesterday.
The bond-equivalent yield on three-month Treasury bills, for example, was quoted late yesterday at 7.72%, compared with 7.16% Friday. 

Investment-grade corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell. 

But prices of junk bonds, which were battered Friday in near standstill trading, rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session.
Junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed.
Some traders said the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying.
In particular, they said, firms such as First Boston Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels. 

""I think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds,"" said John Lonski, an economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc. 

U.S. Treasury bonds were higher in overnight trading in Japan, which opened at about 7:30 p.m. EDT.
The benchmark 30-year bond, for example rose one point in early Japanese trading in reaction to a quick 600-point drop in the Tokyo stock market.
But as Japanese stocks rebounded, Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher. 

Many U.S. trading operations, wanting to keep a watchful eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where U.S. trading would begin, were fully staffed during the Tokyo trading session. 

""Most of the action was during the night session,"" said Michael Moore, trading manager at Continental Bank. 

Jay Goldinger, who often trades overnight for Capital Insight Inc., Beverly Hills, Calif., said trading in Tokyo was ""very active"" but highly volatile. ""We went down 3/4 point in 10 minutes right before lunch, then after lunch we went up 3/4 point in 12 minutes,"" he said.
In Tokyo, trading is halted during lunchtime. 

Tokyo's market turned out to be a bad bellwether for U.S. trading.
When the market opened here, bonds prices fell as the stock market regained strength. 

The bond market's focus on stock activity was so strong yesterday that it overshadowed today's slate of economic data, which includes the government's report on August U.S. merchandise trade and September industrial production. 

Industrial production is expected to have declined 0.2%, according to a consensus of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.
The August trade deficit is expected to have widened to $9.1 billion from $7.58 billion in July.
A widening of that magnitude, said one New York trader, is ""not a favorable number. . . . It could do damage to us."" 

Meanwhile, agency supply is expected to weigh heavily on the market today when the Federal Home Loan Bank prices a $2.3 billion offering of one-year, three-year, five-year and 10-year maturities. 

Tomorrow, the Resolution Funding Corp. will provide details of its first bond issue, which is expected to total between $4 billion and $6 billion and carry a maturity greater than 20 years.
Resolution Funding is a division of Resolution Trust Corp., the new federal agency created to bail out the nation's troubled thrifts. 

And this week the Tennessee Valley Authority plans to price a $3 billion offering, its first public debt borrowing in 15 years. 

""There's lots of supply,"" the New York trader said. ""We have a couple or three tough weeks coming."" 

Treasury Securities 

Prices of Treasury bonds tumbled in moderate to active trading. 

The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted late at a price of 101 19/32, compared with a closing price of 103 12/32 Friday.
The yield on the benchmark issue rose to 7.97% from 7.82%. 

The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 3/32 for a yield of 7.97%, compared with 101 9/32 to yield 7.84%. 

Short-term interest rates fell yesterday at the government's weekly Treasury bill auction.
The average discount rate on new three-month Treasury bills was 7.37%, the lowest since the average of 7.36% at the auction on Oct. 17, 1988.
The average discount rate was 7.42% on new six-month bills, the lowest since the average of 7.35% at the auction on July 31, 1989. 

Here are auction details: 

Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year. 

Both issues are dated Oct. 19.
The 13-week bills mature Jan. 18, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature April 19, 1990.
Corporate Issues 

Investment-grade corporate bonds ended one to 1 1/2 point lower.
There were no new issues. 

Foreign Bonds 

Foreign bonds surged as the dollar weakened against most major currencies. 

Among benchmark issues: 

-- Japan's No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers screens at 96.15, up 1.17 point.
The yield was 5.245%. 

-- West Germany's 6 3/4% issue due June 1999 ended at 98.30, up 0.91 point to yield 6.99%. 

-- Britain's 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 ended 1 1/8 higher at 111 19/32 to yield 10.12%, while the 11 3/4% notes due 1991 rose 21/32 to 98 26/32 to yield 12.74%. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities gave up most of Friday's gains as active issues ended 24/32 to 30/32 point lower. 

Dealers said morning activity was hectic as prices dropped in response to gains in the stock market and losses in Treasury securities, but trading slowed to moderate levels in the afternoon. 

Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 4/32, down 30/32 from Friday; 9 1/2% securities were down 27/32 at 100 5/32; and 10% securities were at 102 2/32, off 24/32.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% securities were at 97 1/4, down 3/4.
On Friday, mortgage issues gained as much as 1 5/32. 

Late yesterday Ginnie Mae 9% securities were yielding 9.39% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.42. 

Traders said there were some busy dealings in Freddie Mac and Federal National Mortgage Association securities because underwriters from last week's heavy slate of real estate mortgage investment conduit issues moved to gather collateral for new deals. 

Offsetting the Remic-related purchases were continued heavy sales by mortgage originators, which are producing increased amounts of fixed-rate mortgage-backed issues with lower rates. 

There was no new-issue activity in the derivative market. 

Municipals 

Rebounding stocks and weaker Treasury prices drove municipal bonds 1/4 to 3/4 point lower in late dealings. 

The session losses left municipal dollar bonds close to where they were before the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday prompted a capital markets rally. 

Trading was hectic during the morning, with players trying to gauge whether equities would continue Friday's free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness.
Tax-exempts started the session flat to a touch higher on anticipation of further stock market erosion, but bond prices rapidly turned south as it became more clear that a repeat of the October 1987 crash wasn't at hand. 

Professionals dominated municipal trading throughout the session.
Traders said retail investors seemed to be hugging the sidelines until a measure of volatility is wrung out of the market. 

New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was off 3/4 at 98 1/2 bid, yielding 7.32%, up 0.07 percentage point from late Friday. 

Florida Board of Education's 7 1/4% issue of 2023 was 5/8 point weaker at 99 1/2 bid.
The 7 1/8% issue of Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority of New York, due 2019, was off 5/8 at 98 1/8 bid.
And Fairfax County, Va., Water Authority's 7 1/4% issue of 2027 was down 3/4 at 99 7/8 bid. 

Serial bond yields were up about 0.05 percentage point.

The spokesman said Laidlaw wouldn't increase its stake in ADT beyond 30% ""without a great deal of thought"" because of British takeover regulations that require a company acquiring more than 30% to extend an offer to the rest of the company's shareholders.
ADT, a security services and auctions company, trades on London's Stock Exchange.

Interspec Inc. reported a net loss of $2.4 million for the fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31.
It said the loss resulted from startup and introduction costs related to a new medical ultrasound equipment system. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported net income of $955,000, or 15 cents a share. 

The manufacturer of ultrasound diagnostic systems, based in Ambler, Pa., reported a nine-month net loss of $2.43 million compared with net income of $2.71 million, or 44 cents a share, for the nine-month period a year earlier. 

In over-the-counter trading, Interspec fell 37.5 cents to $4.25.

Allegheny Ludlum Corp. expects to report third-quarter net of about $34 million, or $1.50 a share, down from $38.4 million, or $1.70 a share, a year earlier, Richard P. Simmons, chairman and chief executive officer, told institutional investors in New York. 

Sales for the Pittsburgh-based producer of specialty steels and other materials fell to about $265 million in the third quarter from $320.5 million a year earlier, he said. 

He said the third-quarter estimate indicates profit for the nine months of $4.65 a share, ""almost equal to the full-year 1988 earnings"" of $108.6 million, or $4.81 a share.
In the first nine months of 1988, net was $85 million, or $3.76 a share. 

Mr. Simmons said the third-quarter results reflect continued improvements in productivity and operating margins. 

He said capital spending next year will rise to about $45 million from about $35 million this year.

U.S. Banknote Co. said it again extended the expiration date of its $7-a-share tender offer for International Banknote Co. to Nov. 15. 

U.S. Banknote said it is in negotiations to sell ""certain facilities,"" which it didn't name, to a third party, and it needs the extension to try to reach a definitive agreement on the sale.
U.S. Banknote said it believes the sale, if completed, apparently would satisfy antitrust issues raised by the U.S. Justice Department about U.S. Banknote's offer to buy International Banknote.
Both of the New York-based companies print stock certificates and currency. 

U.S. Banknote said ""there can be no assurance"" a sale agreement would be concluded.
It also said the tender offer would probably have to be extended further to complete financing arrangements.
U.S. Banknote said Citibank extended the expiration date of its commitment for senior secured financing to Nov. 15. 

The offer, made June 1, has been extended several times.
Closely held U.S. Banknote offered the $7 a share, or $126 million, for as many as 14.9 million shares, or 78.6%, of International Banknote's shares outstanding.
U.S. Banknote said that as of Oct. 13, 16.1 million shares, or about 84.3% of the fully diluted shares outstanding, had been tendered.

Gitano Group Inc. said it agreed to buy 50% of Regatta Sport Ltd., a closely held apparel maker, with the assumption of $3 million of contingent debt. 

Under the terms of the contract, New York-based Gitano has the option to acquire the remaining 50% of Regatta, a maker of men's and women's clothes sold primarily in department stores, under certain conditions.
That 50% is now held by Clifford Parker, Regatta's president and chief executive officer, who will continue to manage Regatta's operations under Gitano.
In 1989, Regatta will have sales ""in excess of $10 million"" and will show a profit, Mr. Parker said. 

Gitano, which makes budget-priced apparel sold mainly through mass merchandisers like K mart and Wal-Mart, said the Regatta acquisition will enhance its strategy to expand into department stores.
This fall, Gitano began manufacturing moderately priced clothes aimed at department stores under the Gloria Vanderbilt trademark, which Gitano recently acquired.

What doesn't belong here? 

A. manual typewriters, 

B. black-and-white snapshots, 

C. radio adventure shows. 

If you guessed black-and-white snapshots, you're right.
After years of fading into the background, two-tone photography is coming back. 

Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black-and-white photos of Hollywood celebrities pitching jeans, shoes and liquor.
Portrait studios accustomed to shooting only in color report a rush to black-and-white portrait orders.
And black-and-white photography classes are crowded with students. 

What's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion, home furnishings and cinematography.
On Seventh Avenue, designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white.
And classic black-and-white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes, spurred, in part, by the backlash against colorization of old films. 

""The pendulum is swinging back to black and white,"" says Richard DeMoulin, the general manager of Eastman Kodak Co. 's professional photography division. 

Until two years ago, sales of black-and-white film had been declining steadily since the 1960s.
But last year, buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications, sales increased 5%, and they are expected to jump at least that much again this year. 

Photographic companies are scrambling to tap the resurging market, reviving some black-and-white product lines and developing new ones.
At Kodak, which largely ignored the market for years, black-and-white film sales now account for nearly 15% of the company's $3 billion in film and paper sales annually, up from 10% three years ago. 

The Rochester, N.Y., photographic giant recently began marketing T-Max 3200, one of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films.
Aimed at commercial photographers, the film can be used in very low light without sacrificing quality, says Donald Franz of Photofinishing Newsletter. 

Also trying to snare a portion of the $2 billion-a-year industry is Agfa Corp., a unit of Bayer AG. Agfa recently signed Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner to endorse a new line of black-and-white paper that's geared to consumers and will compete directly with Kodak's papers.
Slated for market by the end of the year, the paper ""could have been introduced a long time ago but the market wasn't there then,"" says an Agfa spokesman. 

The biggest beneficiary of the black-and-white revival is likely to be International Paper Co. 's Ilford division, known in the industry for its premium products.
Sales of Ilford's four varieties of black-and-white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market, although the company won't say by exactly how much. ""We hope the trend lasts,"" says Laurie DiCara, Ilford's marketing communications director. 

Why all the interest?
For baby boomers who grew up being photographed in color, black and white seems eye-catching and exotic. ""It has an archival, almost nostalgic quality to it,"" says Owen B. Butler, the chairman of the applied photography department at Rochester Institute of Technology. ""You can shift out of reality with black and white,"" he adds. 

Such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives, who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising.
Processing of black-and-white commercial film jumped 24% last year to 18.7 million rolls. 

Consider Gap Inc., whose latest ad campaign features black-and-white shots of Hollywood stars, artists and other well-known personalities modeling the retailer's jeans and T-shirts.
Richard Crisman, the account manager for the campaign, says Gap didn't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors. 

""We wanted to highlight the individual, not the environment,"" he says, ""and black and white allows you to do that better than color."" The campaign won a Cleo award as this year's best ad by a specialty retailer. 

Even food products and automobiles, which have long depended on color, are making the switch.
Companies ""feel black and white will convey a stronger statement,"" says Marc L. Hauser, a Chicago photographer who is working on a black-and-white print ad for Stouffer Food Corp. 's Lean Cuisine.
Other companies that are currently using two-tone ads include American Express Co. and Epson America Inc. 

Portrait studios have also latched onto the trend.
Using black and white, ""we can make housewives look like stars,"" says John Perrin.
His On-Broadway Photography studio in Portland, Ore., doubled its business last year and, he says, is booked solid for the next five. 

One customer, Dayna Brunsdon, says she spurned a color portrait for black and white because ""it's more dramatic.
I show it to my friends, and they all say 'wow. ' It isn't ordinary like color."" 

Still, most consumers aren't plunking black-and-white film into their cameras to take family snapshots.
One big obstacle is that few drugstores develop the film anymore.
Typically, it must be mailed to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned. 

Black-and-white film costs consumers a little less than color film, and processing costs the same.
But for photofinishers, developing costs for black-and-white film are higher. 

Some companies are starting to tackle that problem.
Ilford, for example, recently introduced a black-and-white film that can be processed quickly by color labs.
Intent on wooing customers, the company is also increasing its sponsorship of black-and-white photography classes. 

Similarly, Agfa is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges, offering free black-and-white film and paper as prizes.
And Kodak is distributing an instructional video to processors on how to develop its monochrome film more efficiently. 

Other companies are introducing related products.
Charles Beseler Co., a leading maker of photographic enlargers, introduced last month a complete darkroom starter kit targeted at teen-agers who want to process their own black-and-white photographs.
The kit, which has a suggested retail price of $250 and has already become a bestseller, was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children's photography equipment. ""It seems computers as hobbies have waned,"" says Ian Brightman, Beseler's chairman and chief executive officer. 

But some industry observers believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad.
They cite the emergence of still electronic photography, more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints. 

""Black and white hasn't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color,"" says Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute. ""The color print today is far superior to prints of 10 years ago.
You can't say the same with black and white."" 

But when Popular Photography, a leading magazine for photographers, selected 15 of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography's 150th anniversary, all were black and white. ""It's got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally,"" says Alfred DeBat of Professional Photographers of America. ""That's the appeal.""

While Friday's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy's prospects, a little-known indicator that has faithfully foreshadowed the economy's ups and downs by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity. 

The barometer, developed by analysts at Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research here, reached a record high of 223.0 in August, the latest month available, and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then. 

The latest reading of 223.0 was up from 222.3 in July and 215.3 as recently as March.
The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator, which uses the 1967 average as a base of 100. 

In contrast, the Commerce Department's widely followed index of leading indicators, while up in August, has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year.
Its ragged behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year's end. 

But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index ""makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely,"" says Geoffrey H. Moore, the director of the Columbia facility. 

A leading authority on the business cycle, Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business Cycle Dating Group, the panel of private economists that decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end.
The group normally convenes only when a change in the economy's general course seems likely. 

""No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks,"" Mr. Moore reports. 

Based largely on the recent strength in their index, called the long leading indicator, the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well.
They expect a 2.6% rise in 1990 in the gross national product, after adjustment for inflation. 

Underlying this optimism is the index's longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries, as the case may be, by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators.
Over the full post-World War II era, the Columbia index, on the average, has entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries. 

The comparable lead times for the Commerce index, whose components include the stock market, are far shorter -- 10 months before recessions and only three months before recoveries. 

The Columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved, had it existed, in 1929, before the stock market crash in October that ushered in the Great Depression.
The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash. ""It was an entirely different pattern from what we're seeing now,"" Mr. Moore says. 

A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate bond-price index, which is not a part of the Commerce index.
In August, the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early 1987.
It also rose last Friday, while the stock market sagged. 

Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries, the M2 version of the money supply, adjusted for inflation, and the volume of new home-building permits. 

Notably absent from the Columbia index is the stock market, which Mr. Moore says ""is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy's long-range prospects, though it still is useful for anticipating some short-run twists and turns."" 

As recently as 1975, the stock market -- as reflected in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 common stocks -- was rated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the Commerce index.
It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100, compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components. 

The stock market has lost some precursory power, analysts at the Columbia center claim, because of the growing impact of international developments. 

""Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy,"" Mr. Moore says, citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets, the foreign-trade balance and inflows of foreign capital.
He also feels that the rise of such computer-based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market's relevancy to the economic outlook.

BSN S.A., a leading French food group, said it agreed to acquire Birkel G.m.b.
H., a West German pasta maker.
The value of the acquisition wasn't disclosed. 

The move is in line with BSN's strategy of gradually building its share of the European pasta market through external growth.
BSN will initially acquire a 15% interest in Birkel, a closely held concern.
The French group has an agreement giving it the right to buy all the shares outstanding, and this could be completed within a few months, a BSN spokeswoman said. 

The takeover was submitted for approval by the West German cartel office, BSN said. 

Birkel is West Germany's second-biggest producer of pasta, with sales of 250 million marks ($133.4 million) in 1988.
It has 750 workers at three production units in southwest Germany, and is that nation's leading producer of pasta sauces.

The Dutch company hadn't notified Burmah of its reason for increasing the stake, he said. 

SHV, which last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC, has been pegged by speculators as a possible suitor for Burmah Oil in recent weeks.
SHV also owns 40% of Calor. 

Burmah, which owns the Castrol brand of lubricant oils, reported a 17% rise in net income to #43.5 million ($68.3 million) in the first half.

J.P. Industries Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to sell its Builders' Hardware Group to closely held Nalcor Inc. of Beverly Hills, Calif. 

Terms weren't disclosed, but a J.P. Industries spokesman said the amount J.P. Industries will get for the group is ""a little better than expected by the marketplace, and the marketplace had been expecting $25 million to $30 million."" 

The group consists of Weslock Corp. and JPI Modern Inc. J.P. Industries, which is based in Ann Arbor, Mich., said the sale completes a previously announced program to divest itself of its hardware and plumbing supplies operations.
The company's remaining business is the manufacture and sale of engine and transmissions products for industrial and transportation applications.

Citing a $3.1 million provision for doubtful accounts, Dallas-based National Heritage Inc. posted a loss for its fourth quarter ended June 30. 

A unit of troubled Southmark Corp., the operator of nursing homes and retirement centers said it sustained a net loss of $1.6 million, or nine cents a share, compared with net income of $1.3 million, or eight cents a share, a year earlier.
Operating revenue rose 13% to $22.2 million from $19.7 million in the year-earlier quarter. 

The company said the $3.1 million reserve was created to reflect doubt about the collectability of receivables owed to National Heritage by some of the real estate partnerships it manages.
The company also said expenses incurred by the previous board and management in the recent contest for control were recognized primarily in the first quarter ended Sept. 30. 

National Heritage stock fell 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $1.375 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

An American journalist now is standing trial in Namibia.
This is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over in the expectation that it's going to hold an election. 

The most likely winner will be the Marxist-dominated SWAPO rebels.
The U.S. journalist's ""crime"" was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election's fairness, Bryan O'Linn, was openly sympathetic to SWAPO. Shortly after that, Mr. O'Linn had Scott Stanley arrested and his passport confiscated.
Mr. Stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a proclamation, issued by the South African administrator general earlier this year, which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to ""insult, disparate or belittle"" the election commission. 

The Stanley affair doesn't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in Namibia when SWAPO starts running the government.
To the extent Mr. Stanley has done anything wrong, it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the Namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of suppression by neighboring South Africa.
SWAPO has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the U.N. General Assembly declared it the ""sole, authentic representative"" of Namibia's people in 

Last year, the U.S. brokered a peace settlement to remove Cuba's ""Afrika Korps"" from Angola and hold ""free and fair"" elections that would end South Africa's control of Namibia.
The elections are set for Nov. 7.
In July, Mr. Stanley, editor of American Press International, a Washington D.C.-based conservative wire service, visited Namibia to report on the U.N.-monitored election campaign.
He interviewed Mr. O'Linn, head of a commission charged with investigating electoral intimidation, and reported that Mr. O'Linn was openly sympathetic to SWAPO and indeed had defended its leaders in court.
After Mr. Stanley's article was published in two Namibian newspapers, Mr. O'Linn had criminal charges brought against their editors, publisher and lawyer.
Mr. Stanley was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to Namibia this month. 

Both the State Department and the Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press have protested Mr. Stanley's detention.
Mr. Stanley's arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to derail Namibia's elections.
Both South African and SWAPO extremists are intimidating voters.
The U.S. is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results.
It now has the chance to redress that record in Namibia.
State and the human-rights community should insist that Mr. Stanley and his fellow defendants be released and that the United Nation's monitors make certain that Mr. O'Linn's commission investigates election complaints from all sides.

Commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge Friday. 

Yesterday, the stock market's influence at first created nervousness.
Later, however, it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors. 

Gold, the traditional haven in times of financial crisis, continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar, rising early in the day as the currency fell, and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered. 

Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy.
Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved.
Crude oil declined early, but as the stock market retained early gains, it, too, became stronger, ending with a small net loss. 

Trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines. 

In Chicago, grain and soybean prices rose slightly.
Livestock and meat prices, however, dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork. 

In commodity markets yesterday: 

PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently, first falling and then later rising.
Silver performed quietly.
The spot October gold price rose $4 to $367.30 an ounce.
The more active December delivery gold settled with a gain of $3.90 an ounce at $371.20, after trading as high as $374.
December silver was up 2.3 cents an ounce at $5.163.
Platinum behaved more like an industrial metal, easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy, but recovering later, as the stock market strengthened.
Gold was nowhere the spectacular performer it was two years ago on Black Monday.
For one thing, last Friday, precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its late-in-the-day nose dive, so it couldn't react to it.
Back on Friday, Oct. 16, l987, the stock market declined during the day, and gold prices surged as the stock market fell.
The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $8.70 to as high as $471.60, and the more deferred positions, due to mature as late as March 1989, rose as much as $9.60.
On Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, the October contract tacked on further gains, rising to as high as $491.50 for a gain of almost $20 on top of the Friday advances, before giving up almost $10 of that at the close.
Yesterday's October gain of $4 was miniscule compared with that.
One analyst, Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co., New York, said the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise, with or without the stock market. ""What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened,"" said Mr. Cardillo.
There's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further, he said.
He expects a drop in interest rates, which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising.
Finally, according to Mr. Cardillo, the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit, when the figures are released today.
This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold, he said. 

ENERGY: Worried that Friday's 190-point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy, petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices.
The U.S. benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, closed at $20.59 a barrel for November delivery, down 30 cents.
Some analysts said crude was due for a correction anyhow, following several days of significant gains.
But most market observers agreed that Friday's stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday.
Until yesterday, futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand.
So any bearish indicator, such as Friday's precipitous drop in the stock market, sends shivers through the oil markets as well.
Indeed, after reacting early in the trading day to Friday's plummet, futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market's partial recovery yesterday. 

COPPER: Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved.
The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $1.2745.
Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use.
But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over, according to an analyst.
Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan, which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank.
Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle, the contracting out of work by the company.
Now, the analyst said, only minor points remain to be cleaned up. ""For all intents and purposes, an agreement appears to have been achieved,"" he said.
Copper inventories in New York's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons, to 10,004 tons.
London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined 13,575 tons, to 89,300 tons.
The LME stocks decline was about as expected, but the Comex gain wasn't.
However, this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market, the analyst said.
At one point in futures trading, as the stock market firmed, the December contract rose to as high as $1.2965, but it wasn't able to sustain the gain. ""It was simply overbought,"" he said, and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices. 

COTTON: Futures prices eased, more in reaction to Hurricane Jerry than to any influence of the stock market.
The December contract ended with a loss of 0.22 cent a pound, at 74.48 cents.
Technical considerations following the hurricane, which was a factor in the market Friday, caused prices to decline yesterday, said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities, New York.
Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached Texas and Louisiana, which is part of the Mississippi Delta cotton-growing area.
However, after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane, prices began to slip late Friday, Mr. Simon said.
That selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure, he said.
Colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of Texas and the northern states of the Delta during the coming weekend, Mr. Simon said.
That hasn't yet captured traders' attention, he added. 

SUGAR: Futures prices declined.
The March contract was off 0.32 cent a pound at 13.97 cents.
At one point in early trading the March price rose to as high as 14.22 cents when the stock market recovered, but the price then fell back.
A price-depressing factor, one analyst said, was that India, which had been expected to buy around 200,000 tons of sugar in the world market, didn't make any purchases.
India recently bought 200,000 tons and was expected to buy more, the analyst said.
Another analyst thought that India may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market. ""India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar, it could buy at lower prices,"" said Judith Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York.
At any rate, she added, ""India needs the sugar, so it will be in sooner or later to buy it."" 

FARM PRODUCTS: The prices of cattle and hog futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge Friday will linger in the minds of U.S. consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket, which would hurt demand for beef and pork. 

The price of the hog contract for October delivery dropped its maximum permissible daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound. 

The prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering.
Earlier in the session, the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows.
A broad rally began when several major processors began buying futures contracts, apparently to take advantage of the price dip.

Knight-Ridder Inc. said it would report increased earnings per share for the third quarter, contrary to reported analysts' comments that the publishing company's earnings would be down. 

A company spokesman said he believed the confusion was caused when James Batten, Knight-Ridder's chairman and chief executive, told New York analysts two weeks ago that Knight-Ridder's earnings per share for the first nine months of 1989 would ""be behind a little bit"" from like period of

Knight-Ridder said it agreed with estimates that net income for all of 1989 would be around $2.86 a share, compared with $2.59 a share a year earlier. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Knight-Ridder closed at $51.75, down 37.5 cents.

DD Acquisition said that it already owns 15% of the common shares of the doughnut shop chain and that as of the close of business Friday an additional 11% had been tendered to its offer. 

Dunkin' Donuts is based in Randolph, Mass.

Golden West Financial Corp., riding above the turbulence that has troubled most of the thrift industry, posted a 16% increase of third-quarter earnings to $41.8 millon, or 66 cents a share.
The company earned $36 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. 

Herbert M. Sandler, chairman and chief executive officer of the Oakland, Calif., savings-and-loan holding company, credited the high number of loans added to the company's portfolio over the last 12 months for broadening its earning asset base and improving profit performance. 

However, the executive noted that slackening demand for new mortgages depressed new loan originations to $1 billion, 30% below the same period last year. 

In savings activity, Mr. Sandler said consumer deposits have enjoyed a steady increase throughout 1989, and topped $11 billion at quarter's end for the first time in the company's history.
Deposit growth amounted to $393 million, more than double the year-ago figure.

Whirlpool Corp., Benton Harbor, Mich., said it has developed a process to recover environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, that previously entered the atmosphere during in-home repair of refrigerators and freezers. 

The maker of home appliances said the process, which involves the use of a multilayer plastic bag during repairs to capture the gaseous substance and transport it to a recycling center, is already in use at a number of its service centers, and will be available to all authorized repair centers by spring.
Earlier repairs vented the CFCs out of the home through a hose directly into the atmosphere. 

CFCs are widely used as solvents, coolants and fire suppressants.
But their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the Earth's ozone layer, and a number of companies are seeking to curtail use, or at least emission, of the substance.
Whirpool said, ""We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of CFC use in appliance manufacture.""

Maxus Energy Corp., Dallas, said it discovered a new oil field northeast of its previously discovered Intan Field in the southeast Sumatra area of Indonesia. 

Maxus said it didn't run a production test on the three discovery wells it drilled in the field, which is about 1.6 miles from the Intan Field, because the wells are similar to others drilled at its Intan and Widuri fields. 

However, Maxus said it believes the reserves in the field are about 10 million barrels of oil.
The Intan Field has estimated reserves of 50 million barrels and the Widuri Field has estimated reserves of 225 million barrels. 

Maxus, an independent oil and gas concern, is the operator and owns a 56% interest in the new field, called Northeast Intan.

Environmental Systems Co. said it is restating its results to reduce its reported net income for the first nine months of its fiscal year after discovering it took tax credits that already had been taken last year. 

The Little Rock, Ark., hazardous-waste services company said the restatement will reduce its net for the nine months ended July 31 to $2.5 million, or 17 cents a share, from $3.7 million, or 26 cents a share.
Net for the third quarter, restated, is $1.6 million, or 10 cents a share.
The company previously reported net of $2.3 million, or 15 cents a share.

In Montreal Exchange trading, Memotec closed unchanged at 10.625 Canadian dollars (US$9.05).

For the moment, at least, euphoria has replaced anxiety on Wall Street. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply yesterday to close at 2657.38, panic didn't sweep the world's markets, and investors large and small seemed to accept Friday's dizzying 190-point plunge as a sharp correction, not a calamity.
Many went bargain-hunting. 

Among those sighing with relief was John H. Gutfreund, chairman of Salomon Brothers, who took to the firm's trading floor to monitor yesterday's events.
As the rally gained strength at 3:15 p.m., he smiled broadly, brandished his unlit cigar and slapped Stanley Shopkorn, his top stock trader, on the back. 

At first, it seemed as if history might repeat itself.
As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board, stocks of many of the nation's biggest companies couldn't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers.
By 10:10, the Dow Industrials were off 63.52 points, and the stock of UAL Corp., whose troubles had kicked off Friday's plunge, still hadn't opened. 

But then, as quickly as the Dow had fallen, it began to turn around.
It ended with a gain of 88.12 points. 

By the market's close, volume on the New York exchange totaled more than 416 million, the fourth highest on record.
The Big Board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain, in sharp contrast to Black Monday of 1987.
But the rally was largely confined to the blue-chip stocks, which had been hard hit during Friday's selling frenzy.
Overall, more Big Board stocks lost money than gained. 

And many arbitragers, already reeling from Friday's collapse of the UAL deal, were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, collapsed.
Indeed, the Dow Jones Transportation Average plunged 102.06 points, its second-worst drop in history. 

World-wide, trading was generally manageable.
The Frankfurt stock exchange was hardest hit of the major markets, with blue chips there falling 12.8%.
In London, a midday rally left the market's major index off 3.2%, and Tokyo's leading stock index fell only 1.8% in surprisingly lackluster trading.
Other, more thinly traded Asian markets were hit harder than Tokyo's, but there were no free-fall declines. 

Investors big and small say they learned valuable lessons since the 1987 crash: In this age of computerized trading, huge corrections or runups in a few hours' time must be expected.
What's more, such short-term cataclysms are survivable and are no cause for panic selling. 

Stephen Boesel, a major money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, says, ""There was less panic than in 1987: We had been through it once."" In Somerset, Wis., Adrian Sween, who owns a supplier of nursing-home equipment and isn't active in the stock market, agrees. ""I look at it as a ho-hum matter,"" he says. 

Many other factors played a part in yesterday's comeback.
The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day.
Foreign stock markets, which kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree, began the day off by relatively modest amounts.
The dollar, after falling sharply in overnight trading to 139.10 yen, bounced back strongly to 141.8, thus easing fears that foreigners would unload U.S. stocks. 

And the widely disseminated opinion among most market experts that a crash wasn't in store also helped calm investors.
Many major institutions, for example, came into work yesterday ready to buy some of the blue chips they felt had been sharply undervalued on Friday. 

Still, amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over yesterday's events, some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday's. ""There is too much complacency,"" says money manager Barry Schrager. 

Computers have increasingly connected securities markets world-wide, so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed around the globe.
So investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday's opening in Tokyo, where the Nikkei average of 225 blue-chip stocks got off to a rocky start.
The average plunged some 600 points, or 1.7%, in the first 20 minutes of trading.
But the selling wave had no conviction, and the market first surged upward by 200 points, then drifted lower, closing down 647. 

Unlike two years ago, most of Japan's major investors chose to sit this calamity out.
In Merrill Lynch & Co. 's Tokyo trading room, some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly, with few orders to process.
Clients ""are all staying out"" of the market, one Merrill trader says. 

The relative calm in Tokyo proved little comfort to markets opening up in Europe.
Frankfurt's opening was delayed a half hour because of a crush of sell orders. ""The beginning was chaotic,"" says Nigel Longley, a broker for Commerzbank 

In London, the view from the trading floor of an American securities firm, Jefferies & Co., also was troubling.
A computer screen displaying 100 blue-chip stocks colors each one red when its price is falling.
The screen was a sea of red. ""I see concern, but I don't see panic,"" says J. Francis Palamara, a New Yorker who runs the 15-trader office.
London's blue-chip stock index turned up just before 8 a.m. New York time, sending an encouraging message to Wall Street. 

When trading opened in New York at 9:30 a.m. EDT, stocks fell sharply -- as expected.
Futures markets in Chicago had opened at a level suggesting the Dow would fall by about 60 points.
With sell orders piled up from Friday, about half the stocks in the Dow couldn't open on time.
By 9:45, the industrial average had dropped 27 points.
By 10 a.m., it was down 49.
Ten minutes later, the Dow hit bottom-down 63.52 points, another 2.5%. 

But shortly before then, some of Wall Street's sharpest traders say, they sensed a turn. ""The first thing that caught my eye that was encouraging was Treasury bonds were off,"" says Austin George, head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price. ""It meant that people weren't running pell-mell to the safety of bonds."" 

Shortly after 10 a.m., the Major Market Index, a Chicago Board of Trade futures contract of 20 stocks designed to mimic the DJIA, exploded upward.
Stock traders were buoyed -- because an upturn in the MMI had also started the recovery in stocks on the Tuesday following Black Monday. 

""The MMI has gone better,"" shouted a trader in the London office of Shearson Lehman Hutton.
Shearson's London trading room went wild.
Traders shouted out as their Reuters, Quotron and Telerate screens posted an ever-narrowing loss on Wall Street.
Then, nine minutes later, Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day. ""Rally, rally, rally,"" shouted Shearson's Andy Rosen. ""This is panic buying."" Major blue-chip stocks like Philip Morris, General Motors and Proctor & Gamble led the rally. 

Japanese were said to be heavy buyers.
German and Dutch investors reportedly loaded up on Kellogg Co. Then, traders say, corporations with share buy-back programs kicked into high gear, triggering gains in, among other issues, Alcan Aluminium and McDonald's. 

Walt Disney Co., which had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday and was one of seven stocks that halted trading and never reopened that day, opened yesterday late at 114.5, down 8.5.
But then it suddenly burst upward 7.5 as Goldman, Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought almost every share offer, traders said. 

By 10:25, the Dow had turned up for the day, prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors.
Among Big Board specialists, the cry was ""Pull your offers"" -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares. 

""It was bedlam on the upside,"" said one Big Board specialist. ""What we had was a real, old-fashioned rally."" 

This technical strength spurred buying from Wall Street's ""black boxes,"" computer programs designed to trigger large stock purchases during bullish periods.
Typical, perhaps, was Batterymarch's Dean LeBaron.
Mr. LeBaron, who manages $10 billion, says, ""We turned the trading system on, and it did whatever it was programmed to do."" Asked what stocks the computer bought, the money manager says, ""I don't know."" 

Not everybody was making money.
The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the nation's major options market, was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted Friday.
Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday, and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses.

Chicago investor William Farley agreed to sell three divisions of Cluett Peabody & Co. for about $600 million to Bidermann S.A., a closely held clothing maker based in Paris. 

Shortly after completing the $1.56 billion acquisition of West Point-Pepperell Inc. in April, Mr. Farley's holding company, Farley Inc., said it was considering the sale of Cluett, a leading shirt maker and one of West Point-Pepperell's biggest units. 

Included in the sale are Cluett units that make men's shirts under the Arrow name, socks under the Gold Toe name and menswear through the Schoeneman division. 

The companies said the agreement is subject to Bidermann's receipt of financing and to regulatory and other approvals.
They said the sale is expected to be concluded by the end of November. 

Mr. Farley said the sale of three of Cluett's four main divisions plus other ""anticipated"" West Point-Pepperell asset sales by December, should bring in a total of about $700 million.
He didn't elaborate on other asset sales being considered. 

Mr. Farley followed a similar pattern when he acquired Northwest Industries Inc. and then sold much of its assets.
But he kept Fruit of the Loom Inc., the underwear maker that he still controls and serves as chairman and chief executive. 

Cluett was an independent company until West Point-Pepperell acquired it for $375 million in cash and stock in 1986.
In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1988, Cluett had operating profit of $37 million on sales of $757 million. 

Bidermann sells clothes under various labels, including Yves Saint Laurent and Bill Robinson for men and Ralph Lauren for women.
A spokesman said the company had sales of $400 million in 1988. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, West Point-Pepperell fell 25 cents to $53.875.

Britain's Blue Arrow PLC intends to change its name to Manpower PLC and write off a chunk of the nearly $1.2 billion in good will realized in the takeover of U.S.-based Manpower Inc. 

Blue Arrow Chairman Mitchell Fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to reincorporating the world's biggest employment-services group in the U.S. Mr. Fromstein disclosed the planned steps, expected within a few months, as Blue Arrow posted a 2.5% drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings. 

The name change and good will write-off could help solidify Blue Arrow's dominance of the U.S. temporary-help market and give it a more American image as U.S. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after Friday's market plunge.
U.S. holders now own more than 60% of Blue Arrow compared with 9% last January. ""In the U.S. market, the recognition of the Manpower name is infinitely stronger than Blue Arrow,"" Mr. Fromstein said. 

The moves also could erase shareholders' perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil. ""It further reinforces the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past,"" said Doug Arthur, an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York.
The proposed changes ""all make a lot of sense to me,"" he added. 

In a widely publicized boardroom coup, Mr. Fromstein ousted Antony Berry as Blue Arrow chief executive in January, a month after Mr. Berry had forced Mr. Fromstein out as the $1 million-a-year chief of Milwaukee-based Manpower.
Mr. Fromstein solidified his control in April by taking over from Mr. Berry as chairman. 

But the Blue Arrow tumult isn't over yet, as the British government is investigating a disputed #25 million ($39.4 million) loan which Mr. Fromstein has said was made under Mr. Berry's direction. 

Blue Arrow was able to pull off the $1.34 billion takeover of Manpower in 1987 largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies.
Under British rules, Blue Arrow was able to write off at once the $1.15 billion in good will arising from the purchase.
As a U.S.-based company, Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years, creating a continuing drag on reported earnings. 

Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm, operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets. 

But with so many shares now held in the U.S., Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways, based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards. ""Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice's wonderland,"" Mr. Fromstein said.
The British version shows ""a handful of pounds of net worth"" following the 1987 write-off of good will, while the American version reflects ""$1 billion of net worth because almost none of {the good will} has been written off."" 

Mr. Fromstein said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on Blue Arrow's U.S. books in one fell swoop, but wouldn't specify how much.
People close to Blue Arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk, with executives claiming prior management overstated the extent of Manpower's good will. 

That move, along with the return to the Manpower name, could bolster the company's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help.
The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about 1% in the 12 months ending Aug. 31, after sliding nearly 3.5% in July, said Kidder Peabody's Mr. Arthur. 

Blue Arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July 31 partly on slower earnings growth of non-Manpower units in Britain.
Overall, pretax profit slid to #18.49 million in the quarter from #18.98 million a year earlier.

Richard G. Sim, the man credited with transforming Applied Power Inc. from an underachiever into a feisty player in the global market for hydraulic tools, hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company's latest acquisition, Barry Wright Corp. 

The 45-year-old former General Electric Co. executive figures it will be easier this time.
But analysts, while applauding the acquisition, say Applied's chief executive faces a tough challenge in integrating the two companies. 

Barry Wright, acquired by Applied for $147 million, makes computer-room equipment and vibration-control systems.
The Watertown, Mass., company's sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped.
Last year's earnings of $1.3 million, including $815,000 from a restructuring gain, were far below the year-earlier $8.4 million. 

Besides spurring Barry Wright's sales, which were $201.7 million in 1988, Mr. Sim must pare its costs and product line. ""The question is how long it's going to take Barry Wright to make a contribution,"" says F. John Mirek, an analyst at Blunt Ellis Loewi in Milwaukee. 

The answer will help determine whether Applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. Sim.
The Butler, Wis., manufacturer went public at $15.75 a share in August 1987, and Mr. Sim's goal then was a $29 per-share price by 1992.
Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule, in August 1988.
The stock has since softened, trading around $25 a share last week and closing yesterday at $23.00 in national over-the-counter trading.
But Mr. Sim has set a fresh target of $50 a share by the end of 

Reaching that goal, says Robert T. Foote, Applied's chief financial officer, will require ""efficient reinvestment"" of cash by Applied and continuation of its healthy 19% rate of return on operating capital. 

In Barry Wright, Mr. Sim sees a situation ""very similar"" to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985.
Applied, then a closely held company, was stagnating under the management of its controlling family.
While profitable, it ""wasn't growing and wasn't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital,"" he says. 

Mr. Sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at Barry Wright as it has at Applied.
He also professes an ""evangelical"" fervor to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where decision-making is shared. 

Mr. Sim considers the new unit's operations ""fundamentally sound"" and adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that haven't interested larger competitors. ""With a little patience, these businesses will perform very satisfactorily,"" Mr. Sim says.
Within about six months, ""things will be moving in the right direction,"" he predicts. 

Mr. Sim figures it will be easier to turn Barry Wright around since he's now in the driver's seat.
When he came to Applied, ""I didn't have the power to execute as I do today,"" he says.
He was named chief executive officer of Applied in 1986 and became chairman last November. 

At Applied, Mr. Sim set growth as his first objective.
He took the company public in an offering that netted Applied about $12.6 million, which helped launch the company's acquisition program.
Sales climbed to an estimated $245 million in fiscal 1989, ended Aug. 31, from $99.9 million in fiscal 1985.
The company expects that earnings, which have marched steadily upward in recent years, reached about $20.8 million, or $1.58 a share, in the fiscal year just ended, up from $15.2 million in fiscal 1988 and $3.9 million in 1985.
